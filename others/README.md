## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (automatically installed)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Clearway
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python run.py
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"airportCode": "KJFK"}'
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "airportCode": "KJFK",
  "airportName": "John F Kennedy International Airport",
  "towerHours": [
    {
      "day": "Tower",
      "hours": "24 Hours"
    }
  ],
  "contacts": [
    {

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Find the process
lsof -i :8080

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

### ChromeDriver Issues
If you encounter ChromeDriver errors:
```bash
# The run.py script automatically installs ChromeDriver
# If issues persist, update Chrome to the latest version
```

## Development Status

### Completed
- âœ… USA AIP integration (FAA)
- âœ… Automatic country detection
- âœ… Headless scraping
- âœ… Web interface
- âœ… API endpoints

### In Progress
- ðŸš§ France eAIP integration
- ðŸš§ Additional countries

### Planned
- ðŸ“‹ Support for more countries (Canada, UK, Germany, etc.)
- ðŸ“‹ Caching for improved performance
- ðŸ“‹ Batch airport lookups

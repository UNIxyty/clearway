 3.3.3.  The ICAO AIRAC system is used to provide advance notice of the introduction of permanent 
operationally significant changes on an internationally recognized AIRAC effective date.  AIRAC 
Amendment pages are identified by the footnote AIRAC AMDT and do not replace the existing 
AIP pages until the AIRAC effective date on which the changes take place. 
3.3.4.  Non-AIRAC amendments (AMDT) to the AIP comprise permanent operationally significant changes 
that have received previous notification by NOTAM and other permanent information that is not required to be announced by NOTAM.  Non-AIRAC changes to the AIP are published together 
with AIRAC changes but may be considered to be effective on or before receipt, unless otherwise indicated.  AIP pages (AIRAC and Non-AIRAC) should not be replaced before the stated date of the page. 
3.3.5.  The AIP A mendment cover sheet will indicate any NOTAM or permanent AIP Supplements that 
have been incorporated.  On each replacement page, changes are either annotated or identified in the outer margin of the page by a vertical line or arrow adjacent to the change/ addition/deletion.  
3.3.6.  Each AIP page is dated to reflect the Amendments AIRAC effective date or AIP insertion date and 
a complete checklist of AIP pages, relating page reference to date, is reissued with each amendment as AIP section GEN 0.4. 
3.3.7.  Each combined AIP amendment is allocated an AIRAC Cycle serial number that is consecutive and 
based on the calendar year.   The Cycle, indicated by two digits, is a part of the serial number of 
the amendment, eg. AIRAC Cycle 03 /2021. When necessary to provide additional advance notice 
of AIRAC changes, the Amendment may be issued in several parts, each relating to a common effective date. These Amendments will be identified by a part number suffix, eg. AIRAC Cycle 01/2020 Part 1  
 Supp lements to the AIP (AIP SUP) 
Temporary changes of long duration (three months and longer) and information of short duration, which consists of extensive text and/or graphics, supplementing the permanent information contained in the AIP, are published as AIP Supplements (AIP SUP).   
Operationally significant and temporary changes to the AIP are published in accordance with the 
AIRAC system and its established effective dates and are identified clearly by the acronym AIRAC AIP SUP.   
AIP Supplements are separated by information subject (General-GEN, En -route -ENR and 
Aerodromes -AD) and are placed accordingly at the beginning of each AlP Part.  Supplements are 
published with a yellow background to be conspicuous and to stand out from the rest of the AlP.  
Each AlP Supplement (regular or AIRAC) is allocated a serial number which is consecutive and based on the calendar year, i.e. AIP SUP 11/02; AIRAC AIP SUP 11/02.   
An AIP Supplement is kept in the AIP as long as all or some of its contents remain valid.  The 
period of validity of the information contained in the AIP Supplement will normally be given in the 
supplement itself. Alternatively, NOTAM may be used to indicate changes to the period of validity 
or cancellation of the supplement. 
 NOTAM and Pre -flight Infor mation Bulletins (PlB) 
All operationally significant information not covered by AIP Amendment or AIP Supplement will be issued as a NOTAM (via the Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network - AFTN).  
NOTAM information is forwarded through the Khartoum FIR for distribution.  NOTAM contain 
information concerning the establishment, condition or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedure or hazard, the timely knowledge of which is essential for personnel concerned with

 flight operations.  The text of each NOTAM contains the information in the order shown in the 
ICAO NOTAM Format and is composed of the significations and uniform abbreviated phraseology 
assigned to the ICAO NOTAM Code complemented by ICAO abbreviations, indicators, identifiers, designators, call signs, frequencies, figures and plain language.  NOTAM are originated and issued for Juba FIR and are distributed in two series identified by the letters “A” and “D”.  
Series A.  General rules, en-route navigation and communication facilities, airspace restrictions and information concerning international aerodromes. 
Series D.  All Information concerning domestic airports. 
 Aeronautical Information Circulars (AIC) 
AICs generally refer to subjects of an administrative rather than of an operationa l nature.   They 
are also used to publish advance warnings of impending operational changes and to add 
explanations or emphasis on matters of safety or operational significance.  Aeronautical chart issues are also notified through the medium of the AIC. 
AIC are numbered in series consisting of a Serial number and year; eg AIC 003/2021. AIC 
backgrounds are colour coded according to their subject matter as follows: 
• White - Administrative matters (e.g. licence examination dates, services and publications). 
• Yellow - Operational matters (including ATS facilities and requirements). 
• Pink - Safety related matters. 
• Green - Maps and Charts. 
 Checklist NOTAM 
3.7.1.  A checklist NOTAM will be issued for each AIRAC cycle. 
3.7.2.  A plain language checklist NOTAM summary is distribute d electronically to all registered recipients 
of the Integrated Aeronautical Information Package.  It contains a plain language (in English) 
presentation of the information about the number of the latest issued AIP AMDT, AIRAC AIP AMDT, AIP SUP, and AIC; as well as the numbers of the elements issued under the AIRAC that will become effective, or if none, the NIL AIRAC notification.    
 Sale of Publications 
The publications can be obtained from the Aeronautical Information Service.  Publication unit 
prices are published in AIC white page. 
 
4. AIRAC SYSTEM.  
 In order to control and regulate the operationally significant changes requiring amendments to charts, 
route manuals etc., such changes, whenever possible, will be issued on predetermined dates 
according to the AIRAC SYSTEM.  This type of information will be published as an AIRAC AIP AMDT or an AIRAC AIP SUP.  If an AIR AC AMDT or SUP cannot be produced due to lack of 
time, NOTAM clearly marked AIRAC will be issued.  Such NOTAM will immediately be followed by an AMDT or SUP. 
 There are three significant dates associated with the AIRAC system, namely:  
a) publication date, i.e. the date at which the AIS sends out the information; 
b) latest reception date, i.e. the latest date for new, amended or deleted information to reach the 
recipients; and 
c) the effective date, i.e. the AIRAC date at which the changes take effect.

 Normal processing time for the AIRAC cycle is shown below.  AIRAC information will be issued so 
that the information will be received by the user not later than 28 days, and for major changes not 
later than 56 days, before the effective date.  At AIRAC effective date, a trigger NOTAM will be 
issued giving a brief description of the contents, effective date and reference number of the AIRAC AIP AMDT or AIRAC AIP SUP that will become effective on that date.  Trigger NOTAM must remain in force as a reminder for 14 days after the effective date of change. 
 
 
 ICAO Annex 15, 6.2, on aeronautical information regulation and control, specifies that important 
changes should be maintained by a predetermined production schedule. The schedule of internationally agreed AIRAC effective dates for the years 2021 to 202 5 is given in the follo wing 
table.  If no information was submitted for publication at the AIRAC date, a NIL notification will be 
issued by NOTAM not later than AIRAC cycle before the AIRAC effective date concerned.

 PART 2 . EN-ROUTE  (ENR)  
ENR 1 .  GENERAL RULES AND PROCEDURES  
ENR 1.1 GENERAL RULES  
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
The air traffic rules and procedures applicable to air traffic within the South Sudan FIR conform 
with Annexes 2 and 11 of the Convention on Civil Aviation and to those portions of the DOC 4444, Procedures for Air Navigation Services – Air Traffic Management, and the Regional Supplementary Procedures applicable to the AFI Region, except for the differences as listed in GEN 1.7.  
 
2. FLIGHTS ON AIRWAYS ( AREA CONTROL)  
 Introduction 
2.1.1.  Areas of responsibility for the control of flights on airways and the units providing this service are 
shown in ENR 2.1 
2.1.2.  Separation is based on: 
a) Estimated and actual times over position reporting points; 
b) Reports of visual sighting; 
c) Surveillance identification. 
Note: As position reports are most commonly used it is important for estimates to be revised and notified to the ACC if  more than 3 minutes in error. 
 Communications and Radio Navigation Requirements 
2.2.1.  All aircraft operating under IFR or VFR within controlled airspace shall be equipped with 
appropriate communications and navigation equipment enabling them to: 
a) maintain two -way communication with the appropriate ATC unit. The minimum requirement is 
VHF R/ F equipment  suitable for communicating on ATC frequencies. 
b) maintain track within the lateral limits of the Airway /RNAV Route  and to navigate in 
accordance with ATC instructions. The minimum requirement is one radio compass. 
 Air Traffic Clearance 
2.3.1.  An Air Traffic Clearance is an authorization by ATC for an aircraft to proceed under specified 
conditions within controlled airspace.  If for any reason an air traffic clearance is not acceptable to 
the pilot -in-command, he may request an alternative clearance. 
2.3.2.  The pilot -in-command of an aircraft on an IFR or SVFR  flight plan shall obtain an air traffic 
clearance prior to operating in a controlled airspace. 
2.3.3.  The pilot -in-command of an aircraft not operating on an IFR or SVFR flight plan shall at all times 
maintain appropriate VFR in -flight weather minimums and  obtain an air traffic clearance prior to 
operating in Class A, Class B, Class C, or Class D airspace. 
2.3.4.  An air traffic clearance will contain the following items: 
a) Aircraft identification; 
b) Clearance limit and route instruction;

 d) Departure instruction when necessary; 
e) Approach instruction when necessary; 
f) Clearance expiry time when necessary; 
g) Any special instructions and information. 
2.3.5.  Request for Amended Clearance. If the amended clearance is requested at a time a position report 
is made the information contained in that report shall be given on the assumption that the aircraft 
is proceeding in accordance with the current clearance, and not with that which is being 
requested. 
2.3.6.  The contents of an air traffic control clearance or any revision thereto shall apply only to those 
portions of the flight conducted within controlled airspace. 
2.3.7.  An air traffic control clearance may be issued direct to an aircraft by an ACC or through an 
aerodrome control unit or an air-ground HF R/ F communications unit. 
2.3.8.  Phrases used in air traffic clearances will have the following meanings: 
a) Clearance expires at (Time).  If the aircraft is not airborne by the time stated, a new clearance 
shall be obtained. 
b) Depart not before (Time).   An aircraft will not be cleared for departure until the time specified. 
c) Unable to approve .  When ATC is unable to approve the flight planned level, an alternative 
level will be offered whenever possible, to avoid or reduce delay. 
2.3.9.  A pilot -in-command operating under VFR in controlled airspace's shall not enter instrument 
meteorological conditions without first obtaining an ATC clearance in accordance with the 
procedure laid down for flights joining airways. Until such clearance is received, the aircraft must 
remain in VMC.  
2.3.10.  Where a flight plan specifies IFR for the first portion of a flight and VFR for the latter portion, the 
aircraft will normally be cleared to the point where IFR terminates (clearance is not necessary beyond that point unless within the TMAs and all CTRs).  
2.3.11.  If an ATC clearance stipulates VFR climb or descent and it becomes evident to the pilot-in -
command that VMC cannot be maintained, he shall hold in VMC and request an alternative clearance. 
2.3.12.  The pilot -in-command having acknowledged an air traffic control clearance shall not deviate from 
the provisions of the clearance unless an amended clearance has been obtained. 
2.3.13.  A flight shall normally be cleared to the aerodrome of first intended landing, the point of leaving 
controlled airspace or in the case of a flight where prior coordination with an adjacent unit cannot be established the FIR boundary: this is known as the clearance limit. 
2.3.14.  When an aircraft is cleared to an intermediate p oint en-route and further ATC clearance is 
required, this  will, wherever possible be issued at least 15 minutes before the aircraft arrives at 
the clearance limit, unless the pilot-in -command is instructed to hold over the intermediate point 
until a specified time. 
2.3.15.  In the event of an aircraft arriving at the clearance limit without having received a further 
clearance, the pilot-in-command shall immediately request a further clearance and hold in accordance with the specified holding pattern maintainin g the last assigned cruising level until 
coordination facilities between Regional Control Cent ers exist, pilots on such routes  must 
endeavor, when airborne, to contact the Area Control Centre of the next FIR which the aircraft is entering and obtain clearance to enter its Control Area before reaching the transfer point of the 
two ACCs.

 2.3.16.  When a fl ight operates successively in a control area subsequently along the advisory route or 
area, the clearance issued for the flight or any revisions thereto will only apply to those portions of 
the flight conducted within controlled airspaces. 
 Route and Level Assignment 
2.4.1.  The pilot -in-command shall fly in strict accordance to the route specified by ATC.  Deviation from 
the specified route may be permitted by ATC if traffic conditions permit. 
2.4.2.  Traffic permitting ATC will assign the flight planned level if in accordance with the table of semi-
circular system of Cruising Levels.  Cruising levels below the minimum specified in ENR 3.1 will 
not be assigned.

but, which in relation to a particular controlled traffic, does not have the required minimum 
separation. 
2.5.2.  Essential traffic information shall be issued to controlled flights concerned whenever they constitute 
essential traffic to each other.  
Note: This information will inevitably relate to controlled flights which are cleared subject to maintaining own separation and remaining in visual meteorological conditions. 
2.5.3.  Essential traffic information shall include: 
a) Direction of flight of aircraft concerned; 
b) Type of aircraft concerned; 
c) Level(s) of aircraft concerned and estimated time of passing or if this is not available, the 
estimated time of arrival for the reporting point nearest to where the level will be crossed.

 VFR flight Crossing Airways 
2.7.1.  VFR flights intending to cross airways below FL 145 outside the Terminal Class D Areas shall only 
cross them at various levels plus 500 ft at an angle of 90° to the direction of the airways, or as 
close as possible to this angle. 
2.7.2.  In an emergency, where neither surveillance nor a procedural crossing can be obtained, an airway 
may be crossed at various levels plus 500 ft. The various levels referred to are flight levels of 
whole thousands in feet. 
 VFR flights shall NOT be operated: 
a) In Class A airspace; or  
b) by night in all airspace; 
c) by day in Class B, Class C, and Class D airspace without an appropriate ATC clearance. 
 Temporary Danger Areas on Airways 
2.9.1.  Military operations, both air and grou nd may take place within the Juba FIR.  Danger areas will be 
promulgated  by NOTAM, giving the reference point, vertical extent. radius and duration of the 
operation.  
2.9.2.  Where danger areas infringe controlled airspace, the areas will not be available for use by civil 
aircraft at the levels affected. 
 IFR Flights outside Terminal Areas and CTRs in VMC 
2.10.1.  The pilot -in-command of an aircraft operating under IFR outside the Terminal Areas/CTRs below 
FL 245 may request a VFR clearance for any portion of the flight.  In the absence of such a 
request, ATC will issue a full lFR clearance regardless of weather conditions. 
2.10.2.  Outside the Terminal Areas/CTRs when necessary to expedite traffic, ATC may request a pilot-in -
command operating under IFR below FL 245 to conduct portion of the flight under VFR.  An 
alternative clearance will be issued if the pilot-in -command has any doubt as to his ability to 
maintain VFR.  
3. AIR TRAFFIC ADVISORY  SERVICE  
 Introduction 
3.1.1.  Air Traffic Advisory Service is provided in areas or airspace where it is desirable to make 
information on collision hazards more effective than Flight Information Service provides, but facilities for the introduction of positive control are inadequate, or positive control cannot be applied for some reason. 
Note: Air Traffic Advisory Service is normally implemented as a temporary measure pending the implementation of positive control 
3.1.2.  In addition to the provision of information on known traffic, Advisory Service offers suggestions and 
advice to assist the pilot-in-command to avoid collision with other aircraft. 
3.1.3.  Generally, procedures in advisory areas or airspace are similar to those in control areas.

 3.1.4.  Juba Center provides Air Traffic Advisory Service within defined areas of responsibility using ICAO 
standard separation. Units and the areas or routes they serve are shown in ENR 3. 
3.1.5.  Air Traffic Advisory Service does not provide for terrain clearance, which is the responsibility of the 
pilot-in-command. 
3.1.6.  There is no obligation on the part of a pilot-in -command to make use of this service and it does not 
therefore afford the  same degree of safety and cannot assume the same responsibilities as air 
traffic control service since there may be unknown or unreported traffic operating in the advisory 
area or airspace. 
3.1.7.  The words "Advice” or “suggested" will be used in advisory messages passed to the pilot-in -
command by ATC. The pilot-in -command shall then indicate whether he intends to comply with 
the advice or suggestion. 
3.1.8.  A flight in an advisory area or airspace will not be subject to an air traffic clearance, but any 
changes in flight plan or flight progress should be notified to ATC. 
 Procedures 
3.2.1.  In electing to use the air traffic advisory service within the specified advisory areas and airspace, 
the pilot -in-command shall comply with the procedures applicable to flights within controlled 
airspace. 
3.2.2.  Requirements for the submission of a flight plan prior to departure or in flight are similar to those for 
flights in controlled airspace. 
3.2.3.  Traffic intending to cross an advisory area or airspace should request the permission of ATC. If 
unable to effect direct contact, notification should be passed relay by another unit. 
3.2.4.  In crossing the advisory area or airspace the pilot-in -command should in so far as possible select a 
point associated with a radio facility to assist accurate navigation; and should cross as nearly as 
possible at right angle to minimize the time spent in the advisory area or airspace and at a level, 
appropriate to its track selected from the table of quadrantal cruising levels f or us e by flights 
operating outside controlled airspace. 
3.2.5.  If operating IFR in an advisory area or airspace and not electing to use the air traffic advisory 
service, pilot-in -command should maintain a listening watch on the appropri ate frequency and 
notify ATC of 
a) Position, true airspeed, cruising leveI and route, at hourly intervals; and 
b) Any intended change in route or cruising levels. 
3.2.6.  The clearance limit of a flight will be the point at whi ch the ai rcraft leaves the advisory area or 
airspace. Where the destination airfield is situated on an advisory area or airspace in Juba FIR 
the clearance limit will be the destination airfield.  
4. FLIGHT INFORMATION S ERVICE (FIS)  
 Introduction 
4.1.1.  Flight Information Service (FIS) is provided both within and outside controlled or advisory airspace 
by all ATS units. 
4.1.2.  Within the South Sudan FIR but outside controlled or advisory airspace, the Flight Information and 
Alerting Service established at Juba ACC will, for ease of reference, be known as Juba Flight 
Information and the Area Controll er will normally  carry out the duties of the Flight Information 
Controller.

 4.1.3.  In addition to the normal Flight Information and Alerting Service provided by all ATS Units, the 
Flight Information Controller  Will provide extra services to aircraft, which communicate with him 
whilst they are flying outside controlled and advisory airspace. 
 Scope of Flight Information Service 
4.2.1.  FIS shall include pertinent information concerning: 
a) SIGMET warnings, both reported and forecast which may affect the safety of flight; 
b) changes of serviceability of navigational and approach aids; 
c) conditions of aerodromes and associated facilities; 
d) other information which is considered pertinent to safety. 
4.2.2.  In addition to the information outlined in 4.2.1, FIS provided to IFR flights outside controlled and 
advisory airspace will include: 
a) the acceptance of airborne flight plans; 
b) the provision, when requested, of clearance to join or cross controlled airspace; 
c) the passing of EA Ts to destination aerodromes outside controlled airspace under special 
circumstances (e.g. diversions); 
d) warnings of proximity hazards; 
e) weather conditions, both reported and forecast, at destination and alternate aerodromes. 
4.2.3.  In addition to the information outlined in 4.2.1, FIS provided to VFR flights will include weathe r 
conditions, both reported and forecast, which could make flight under VFR impracticable. 
 General Application 
4.3.1.  FIS is provided at the discretion of the controller concerned or at the request of the pilot made 
either before departure or whilst in flight. 
4.3.2.  In providing FIS, the controller is not provided with sufficient reliable information on all of the flights 
within the airspace for which he has limited responsibility to enable him to offer aircraft more than 
an information service. He has no authority to issue either clearances or instructions to aircraft in communication with him except when acting on behalf of other ATS units possessing positive powers of control.  Accordingly, the controller will usually preface his remarks with "you are informed that…”, when, in his opinion, an aircraft should be given certain information which may 
affect the conduct of flight. 
4.3.3.  The provision of ATC Service shall normally take precedence over the provision of FIS. 
 Proximity Warnings 
4.4.1.  Due to many factors the Flight Information Controller cannot be provided with an accurate display 
of air traffic flying outside controlled airspace and advisory area.  He cannot, therefore, supply an ATC Service, but is empowered to offer a proximity warning service to aircraft in communication with him.  
4.4.2.  The Flight Information Controller cannot be expected to have a knowledge of all the geographical 
positions in the FIR and their proximity to each other, neither can he plot aircraft position reports given by different methods (i.e. latitude and longitude, bearing and distance, geographical positions, etc.) in order to forecast possible collision hazards.

 4.4.3.  The Flight Information Controller may offer a limited proximity warning service and may give traffic 
information to aircraft in communication with him as follows: 
a) proximity warnings may be issued to aircraft when positive and self-evident information is 
received by the Fight Information Controller indicating that aircraft are, or will be in dangerous 
proximity to each other; 
b) the Flight Information Controller may at his discretion, or on request, inform a pilot of the 
presence of other known traffic in the vicinity; 
c) the issue of proximity warnings and traffic information is wholly at the discretion of the Flight 
Information Controller.  A s indicated above such information may be based on data of 
doubtful accuracy and completeness, therefore, the Flight Information Controller cannot assume responsibility for their issuance at all times nor for their accuracy. 
4.4.4.  The provision of ATC Service shall normally take precedence over the provision of FIS. 
 
5. AERODROME/ APPROACH CONTROL SERVICE  
 Introduction 
5.1.1.  Aerodrome/Approach Control issue air traffic clearances, instructions and information to aircraft to 
ensure the safe, orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic. 
5.1.2.  In VMC, all aircraft flying in a control zone (CTR) or aerodrome traffic zone (ATZ) and all traffic on 
the man euvering area of the aerodrome (with the exception of the marshalling area) come under 
Aerodrome Control.  This does not, however, relieve the pilot- in-command from the responsibility 
for avoiding collisions. 
5.1.3.  In IMC, control of traffic on the runway in use in the air is shared between Aerodrome Control and 
Approach Control.   Normally departing aircraft are transferred to Approach Contr ol when 
airborne, whilst arriving aircraft are transferred to Aerodrome Control  when properly sequenced 
for approach to land.  The actual point of transfer depends on traffic conditions between the two 
units , accordingly control of traffic on other parts o f the man euvering area, with the  exception of 
the marshalling area, is the responsibility of Aerodrome Control.  
5.1.4.  CTR dimensions and controlling authorities are specified in ENR 3. 
 Procedures 
5.2.1.  Holding instrument approach, arrival and departure procedures are specified in ENR 1.5. 
5.2.2.  Radio communication shall be established with the appropriate Aerodrome/Approach Control Unit: 
5.2.3.  For IFR or VFR operations in a CTR, aircraft shall be equipped with appropriate two-way VHF radio 
apparatus, plus a radio compass. The appropriate Controlling Authority may grant exemptions. 
5.2.4.  Aircraft shall call aerodrome/approach control on VHF approximately 10 minutes before ETA at the 
Zone boundary (or 20 minutes, where communications are on HF R/T). 
5.2.5.  A pilot -in-command under lFR or VFR about to enter, cross or operate within a CTR or ATZ shall: 
a) notify aerodrome/approach control on the appropriate radio frequency of the aircraft's 
position, level and track; 
b) estimated time of crossing the zone boundary; 
c) maintain a continuous listening watch of that frequency while the aircraft is within the zone; 
d) navigate in accordance with the flight plan and ATC clearance;

 e) carry out instructions received from aerodrome/approach control. 
5.2.6.  All flights within a control zone, by night or in IMC, shall be conducted in accordance with IFR or 
special authorization by ATC.  However, at any time, in order to expedite traffic, ATC may 
authori ze IFR flights to execute visual approaches if the pilot reports that he has the aerodrome in 
sight, can maintain visual reference to the surface and:  
a) the reported cloud ceiling is not below the initial approach level for the aircraft cleared; 
b) the pilot reports at any time during the initial or the intermediate approach procedure, that the 
visibility will permit a visual approach and he has reasonable assurance that the landing can 
be accomplished. 
5.2.7.  VFR flights specially authorized by ATC and without radio, may be permitted in a CTR under 
special circumstances, subject to traffic permitting.  In this case, permission shall be obtained 
before departure and the flight shall be conducted in strict accordance with such conditions as may be specified. 
5.2.8.  Flights within a CTR may be specially authorized by ATC when weather conditions fall below the 
minima for VFR flights.  Such flights when so a uthorized, shall be flown clear of cloud and in sight 
of the ground or water.  
5.2.9.  Separation shall be effected between all specially authorized flights and between such flights and 
all IFR flights.  
 Separation Standards  applied shall be in accordance with ICAO Doc 4444 (PANS-ATM)  
 Traffic and Taxi Circuits 
The following positions in the traffic and taxi circuits are the positions where aircraft normally request and, 
depending on the traffic situation, receive air traffic control clearances and instructions: 
 
a) Parking Position. Aircraft requests start-up approval, if required, and taxi instruction for 
departure.  
b) Holding Point Aircraft reports ready for departure, if requested. Departing aircraft are held at this point until permission to line up or take-off clearance can be issued. 
c) Take-off Position. Take-off clearance shall be issued here if not practicable at position b). 
d) Downwind. Aircraft reports on downwind if requested. Landing clearance may be issued. e) Base. Aircraft reports on base leg if requested. Landing clearance may be issued if not 
practicable at position d). 
f) Final. Aircraft reports on final if requested. Landing clearance shall be issued if not practicable 
at positions d) or e). 
g) Turn -off Position. Taxi instruction to the apron or the instruction to contact ground control resp. 
apron shall be issued.

Note: At grass or unpaved aerodromes, the area to be used for landing is regarded as the runway for the 
purpose of reporting position in the circuit.  
 Use of Runway 
5.5.1.  The Aerodrome/Approach Controller will nominate the runway direction according to prevailing 
circumstances. 
5.5.2.  Notwithstanding the runway direction nominated by ATC, the pilot-in -command shall ensure that 
there is sufficient length of run and that the crosswind or downwind component is within the 
operational limits of each particular operation.  If the  nominated runway direction is not suitable 
for these reasons or for any other safety reason, the pilot -in-command may request for an 
alternative runway direction.  The decision to undertake a take-off or a landing on a water -
affected runway or when the presence of birds has been advised rests solely with the pilot-in -
command. 
5.5.3.  Unless prior permission has been obtained from ATC, the pilot-in -command of an aircraft that has 
been cleared for takeoff shall not hold on the runway-in -use. 
5.5.4.  During daylight hours, in VMC, an aircraft may be cleared to continue approach to a runway 
occupied by a proceeding aircraft but clearance to land will not be given until the runway is 
vacated. 
 Closure of Aerodromes 
5.6.1.  Aircraft will not be refused permission to land or take-off from airfields in Juba FIR solely because 
of adverse weather conditions. The pilot-in -command of public transport aircraft shall be 
responsible for operations in accordance with applicable company weather minima. 
5.6.2.  Aerodromes will be closed: 
a) when the surface of the landing area is unfit e.g. soft surface or dangerous obstruction on the 
maneuvering area; or  
b) at such other times and in conditions specified by NOTAM.

 5.6.3.  In an emergency an aircraft will be permitted to land regardless of the conditions of the aerodrome 
or aerodrome facilities, but the pilot will be advised of these conditions. 
 Air Traffic Clearance 
5.7.1.  All flights within a CTR or ATZ, irrespective of weather conditions, require an air traffic clearance. 
This is not applicable in Class E airspace where VFR flights are permissible and for such flights 
an ATC clearance is not necessary. 
5.7.2.  The pilot -in-command of an aircraft departing from a CTR shall obtain an air traffic clearance prior 
to departure . 
5.7.3.  A clearance to enter or to cross a CTR or ATZ will include the following information: 
a) a clearance limit and holding instructions, if necessary; 
b) the route to be flown; and  
c) the altitude or flight level. 
 Suspension of VFR Flights 
5.8.1.  VFR flights shall not be permitted to take-off or land at an aerodrome within a control 
zone/aerodrome traffic zone or enter the traffic pattern when:  
a) 1/2 or more of cloud ceiling is less than 2500 ft; or 
b) the ground visibility is less than 9.2 km (5 NM). 
 Start U p Procedure 
5.9.1.  The pilot -in-command of an aircraft shall listen out on the appropriate aerodrome control tower 
frequency as early as possible prior to starting engines in anticipation of an instruction or a 
message that may come from ATC.  When ready  to start, ATC must be immediately advised so 
that there would be sufficient time for the issue of airway clearance to the aircraft. 
5.9.2.  For all aircraft operating at the airfields within Control Zones at which Aerodrome Control Services 
are provided, prescribed procedures below shall apply. The pilot-in -command shall: 
a) just prior to starting engines, obtain a start-up clearance; 
b) after start -up, obtain ATC clearance; 
c) report ready for take-off.  
5.9.3.  Departing aircraft will be instructed when to change from aerodrome/approach to en-route/airways 
control frequency. 
 Aerodrome Traffic Zone 
5.10.1.  Pilots -in-command of aircraft operating at airfields within Aerodrome Traffic Zones are also 
requested to comply with the above procedures. 
 Taxiing 
5.11.1.  The pilot-in-command shall obtain clearance before leaving the parking area. 
Note: Taxi clearance will relate to movement on the man euvering area, but exclude the marshalling area. 
5.11.2.  Aircraft taxiing on the man euvering area wil l be regulated by ATC to avoid or reduce possible 
conflict and will be provided with a traffic information and alerting service. 
5.11.3.  The pilot -in-command shall not taxi his aircraft on to the runway in use except with the permission 
of aerodrome control.

 5.12.1.  The pilot -in-command shall not take-off or land without a clearance from aerodrome control. 
5.12.2.  The pilot -in-command shall not run-up on the runway in use unless authorised by aerodrome 
control. Engine run-ups  may be carried out in the holding pan or taxiway holding point clear of the 
runway in use. 
5.12.3.  After landing, the pilot -in-command shall vacate the runway by the shortest possible route or in 
accordance with instructions from aerodrome control. 
5.12.4.  Non-radio equipped aircraft shall stop after vacating the runway and watch for light signals from 
aerodrome control tower. 
 Arriving Aircraft 
5.13.1.  The p ilot-in-command of an arriving aircraft shall contact the appropriate approach control 10 
minutes before entering the CTR or ATZ.  
5.13.2.  Arriving IFR traffic operating into a controlled aerodrome will be issued with the following weather 
information:  
a) wind direction and speed; 
b) visibility; 
c) present weather; 
d) cloud base and amount; 
e) QNH; and  
f) Any other significant meteorological information. 
Note If the aircraft reports VMC below cloud and it is apparent that it can maintain VMC, only the surface wind and appropriate pressure need be given unless a full report is requested by the pilot. 
 Instrument Approach 
5.14.1.  Instrument approaches are specified in AD. 
5.14.2.  An expected approach time will be issued on initial contact with approach control.  Any revisions 
will be notified immediately  to the pilot -m-command. 
 Missed Approach 
5.15.1.  In the event of a missed approach the pilot-in -command shall carry out the published missed 
approach specified i n AD.  
 Aerodrome Flight Information Service 
5.16.1.  A flight information service is provided at certain notified aerodromes where no Air Traffic Control 
is established. 
5.16.2.  The Service called "Aerodrome Flight Information  Service" may be provided at some of the less 
busy aerodromes and airstrips where lack of suitable staff or scarcity of movements precludes the 
establishment of an Aerodrome Control Service. 
5.16.3.  The function of the “ Aerodrome Flight Information Service" is to provide certain vital information to 
pilots wishing to land.   It is not an Air Traffic Service. 
5.16.4.  Pilots will be given the information they re quire but will be expected to decide for themselves what 
action they should take. For example, they will be told the wind direction and speed but they will have to make up their own decision as to which runway should be used.  They can however be 
advised of the direction of the runway nearest in to wind, but this need not necessary be used.

 5.16.5.  The fundamental difference between the “Aerodrome Flight Information Ser vice" and an Air Traffic 
Control Service such as Aerodrome or Approach Control Service is that in the “ Aerodrome Flight 
Information Se rvice”, no "Control" of aircraft is exercised nor are instructions passed to pilots.  It 
is essentially an advisory only service. 
5.16.6.  The Aerodrome Flight Information Se rvice will operate as follows: 
a) provision of aerodrome weather information; 
b) information of the state of serviceability of the aerodrome and its facilities; 
c) provision of information on vehicular traffic on the mane uvering area;  
d) provision of aerodrome crash and fire services and alerting of other local emergency 
services; 
e) provision of emergency aerodrome lighting. 
 Special VFR Flight 
5.17.1.  A Special VFR Flight provides flexibility during Instrument Meteorological Conditions (or at night, if 
so authorized by the Civil Aviation Authority), in a control zone to a pilot who is unable to comply 
with Instrument Flight Rules. 
5.17.2.  Special VFR flights may be authorized to enter a control zone for the purpose of landing or take-
off and depart directly from a control zone. 
5.17.3.  Special VFR flights may be authorized only when the ground visibility is not less than 1 NM , (1.85 
KM).  
5.17.4.  Special VFR flights must not be allowed to hinder or interfere with IFR flights and must therefore 
be regarded as a concession, which will only be granted when traffic conditions permit.  IFR 
flights take precedence over Special VFR Flights. 
5.17.5.  A Special VFR clearance shall be issued only when specifically requested by a pilot. 
5.17.6.  A pilot requesting a Special VFR clearance sh all: 
a) submit a flight plan or a flight notification; 
b) comply with ATC instructions; 
c) be responsible for ensuring that he flies within the limitations of his license;  
d) be responsible for ensuring that he is able to remain clear of cloud, in sight of the surface and 
keep clear of obstacles; 
e) be responsible for maintaining the minimum safe altitude/low flying restrictions as prescribed 
in ENR 3.  
5.17.7.  Authori zation for Special VFR Flights will depend upon traffic conditions, the extend of the 
proposed flight and whether or not air/ground communications can be maintained. 
5.17.8.  Special VFR Flights will not normally be given a specific level to fly; they will be merely instructed 
to remain clear of clouds and in sight of the surface.  However, if it is necessary to maintain 
vertical separation from other aircraft above, the Special VFR aircraft may be required to remain below a specified level. 
5.17.9.  Aircraft flying under Special VFR authorization are subject to the general flight rules. Compliance 
with these rules is the responsibility of the pilot.

 6. LIGHT AIRCRAFT OPERA TION  
 General  
6.1.1.  Light aircraft operations will normally be conducted under VFR. Request for operation under IFR 
may be approved if the aircraft is suitable equipped and the pilot appropriately rated. IFR flights 
will be r egulated in accordance with the procedural system. 
6.1.2.  Flight notification shall be given by telephone or by filing a flight plan prior to departure. Flight 
notification by means of R/T should be avoided. 
6.1.3.  For circuits and landings or local flights in the vicin ity of an aerodrome of not more than one hour's 
duration, verbal flight notification is acceptable. The following information should be given: 
a) aircraft identification; 
b) numbers of persons on board; 
c) ETD;  
d) flight duration;  
e) total endurance; 
f) area of flight.  
6.1.4.  For flights other than those classified in 6.1.3, a flight plan shall be filed. 
6.1.5.  Light aircraft engaged on flying training or proceeding outside a CTR/ATZ shall maintain VHF 
communication. 
6.1.6.  Non-radio equipped aircraft may operate at an airfield at the discretio n of ATC when traffic 
conditions permit.  The light  signals specified in Appendix "A" shall be strictly adhered to. 
6.1.7.  Light aircraft engaged on airways procedural flights shall, in addition to radio communication 
apparatus, be equipped with a radio compass. 
6.1.8.  Where a grass strip Is available, light aircraft will use the grass strip, but if the strip is unserviceable 
ATC approval may be sought for the runway to be used. 
6.1.9.  Non-radio eq uipped aircraft will be controlled by the prescribed lamp from the Tower and, in-flight 
shall acknowledge by rocking the wings. 
6.1.10.  Aircraft not in radio contact will be given light signals on downwind and final positions as shown in 
Section 7 , below .

 1.5 HOLDING, APPROACH AND DEPARTURE PROCEDURES  
 
1. GENERAL  
 The holding, approach and departure procedures in use for the aerodromes listed in the table below 
are based on those contained in ICAO Doc 8168 - Procedures for Air Navigation Service-Aircraft 
Operations  (PANS- OPS).  
 Initial approach tracks and holding patterns are detailed in AD on specific approach charts prepared 
for the purpose. 
 Pilots are expected to know the correct holding, approach and departure procedures (although ATC 
will provide this information on request). 
 When an aircraft making an instrument approach by day establishes continuous visual reference with 
the ground or  water above the minimum altitude, it may discontinue instrument approach. The 
pilot-in-command shall be solely responsible for ensuring obstacle clearance from the time visual 
flight is assumed. In all cases ATC shall be advised. 
 
2. ARRIV ING FLIGHTS  
 IFR flights entering, and landing within a Terminal Control Area will be cleared to a specified holding 
point and instructed to contact Approach Control at a specified time, level or position.  The terms 
of this clearance shall be adhered to until further instructions are received from Approach Control.  If the  clearance limit is reached before further instructions have been received, holding procedures shall be carried out at the level last authorised. 
 Pilots are strongly requested to inform ATC if for any reason the approach and/or holding cannot be 
performed as required and ask for permission to follow an alternative procedure.  Permission will normally be given if traffic conditions permit. 
 Standard instrument arrival (STAR) 
2.3.1.  STAR’s serve to connect the en-route structure with the instrument approach. 
2.3.2.  When cleared to “descend via” a STAR the pilot shall comply with all published altitude restrictions 
on the STAR, including the published entry altitude and published final altitude, unless otherwise instructed by ATC.   
2.3.3.  After completing a “descend via” STAR the pilot shall maintain the final STAR published altitude 
unless a specific ATC clearance is received.  Clearance for an instrument approach procedure constitutes such a clearance.  
   Example:  “ … descend via XXX STAR, cleared RNAV Runway 13 Approach.” 
 Approach Instructions 
2.4.1.  ATC clearance or control instructions for approach to an aerodrome or holding point will be issued 
to an arriving aircraft on initial contact or as soon thereafter as possible w ith the approp riate ATC 
unit. 
2.4.2.  The clearance will specify the clearance limit, route and level to be flown. An Expected Approach 
Time will be included if it is anticipated that the arriving aircraft will be required to hold.

Effective: 17 JUN 2021    
 
 
 2.4.3.  An arriving IFR aircraft flight  shall not be cleared for an initial approach below the appropriate 
minimum altitude as specified by the state concerned nor descend below the altitude unless: 
a) the pilot has reported passing an appropriate point defined by a radio aid; or 
b) the pilot reports  that he has and can maintain the aerodrome in sight; or 
c) the aircraft is conducting a visual approach; or 
d) the aircraft's position has been positively determined by the use of surveillance. 
 Visual Approach 
2.5.1.  An IFR flight may be cleared to execute a visual approach provided: 
a) the pilot reports that visual reference to the terrain can be maintained all the way to the 
aerodrome of intended landing; or  
b) the pilot reports at the initial approach level or at any time during the instrument approach 
that the meteorological conditions are such that with reasonable assurance a visual approach 
and landing can be completed. 
2.5.2.  Separation shall be provided between an aircraft cleared to execute visual approach and other 
arriving and departing aircraft. 
 Weather Informa tion 
2.6.1.  Weather information will be passed to inbound aircraft on request or when conditions fall below the 
following:  
a) More than 3/8 cloud cover at or below 3000 ft; or  
b) Visibility 5NM  or less. 
2.6.2.  Deteri oration and improvement weather reports and significant weather information, e.g. severe 
turbulence, thunderstorms, etc. will be passed to all aircraft concerned. 
 
3. DEPARTING FLIGHTS  
 IFR flights departing from controlled aerodromes will receive initial ATC clearance from the local 
Aerodrome Control Tower. The clearance limit will normally be the aerodrome of destination. 
Such a clearance or revisions thereto shall apply to those portions of the flight conducted within controlled airspace. 
 The _term "clearance" when used in connection with flights within the advisory airspace does not 
have the mandatory significance of a clearance relating to a flight within controlled airspace.  A 
clearance given in respect of a flight within a route or area in which advisory service only is provided indicates that the information is of an advisory nature only. 
 Detailed instructions will normally be issued with regard to routes, turns etc, before take-off.  
 Departure Instructions 
3.4.1.  To expedite departure, ATC may require a succeeding aircraft to do a "step-up" climb beneath the 
altitude or level of preceding aircraft, maintaining at least 1000 (or 2000) ft vertical separation as applicable. 
3.4.2.  ATC may instruct a departing aircraft to leave a reporting point at a specified time or to be at a 
specified level at a specified point or time. The pilot-in-command shall notify ATC if these 
instructions cannot be complied with.

 3.4.3.  When cleared to “climb via” a SID the pilot shall comply with all published altitude restrictions on 
the SID, unless otherwise instructed by ATC.   
Example:  ”… climb via XXX departure maintain Flight Level 180.”  The pilot will climb the aircraft 
in such a manner to meet all published SID restrictions and then maintain FL180 until further 
cleared by ATC. 
 
4. AIR / GROUND COMMUNICATION FAILURE  
 Basic Procedure 
4.1.1.  In the radio failure  procedures given below, the expression "E-A-T" will mean either an EAT given 
by the appropriate ATC unit or the ET A, over the holding point, if the pilot has been told "No delay 
expected". 
4.1.2.  The message "delay not determined" will not be considered to be an EAT for the purpose of radio 
failure procedures. Pilots whose radios fail after they have received this message but before an 
EAT is given should not attempt to land at their planned destination aerodrome, but should fly to another suitable aerodrome, following the procedure given in sub-paras 4.1.3 (c) and 4.1.3. (d). 
4.1.3.  The basic procedure is: 
a) Continue the flight in accordance with the current flight plan to the holding point at the 
aerodrome of first intended landing. Maintain the last acknowledged cruising level(s) shown in the flight plan.  
b) Arrange the flight so as to arrive over the holding point at, or as close as possible to, the ETA 
last acknowledged by ATC.  
c) After passing the compulsory reporting point at which the pilot failed to contact ATC. he 
should turn by 60 degree left or right of his track and leave controlled airspace or advisory route maintaining the last cleared level; 
d) If radio failure occurs inside a CTR or TMA, the pilot should proceed as cleared to the 
reporting point nearest to the boundary of the CTR or TMA before leaving controlled airspace 
as described above. 
e) When clear of controlled airspace or advisory route , climb to either : 
i. the cruising level requested in the filed flight plan if operating on a RLCE clearance; or 
ii. the accepted level on a heading that will keep the aircraft clear of controlled airspace 
and/or advisory route for a minimum period of five minutes and is also compatible with rejoining the intended airway or advisory route when the cruising level is reached 
f) W hen at cruising level, return to controlled airspace or advisory route and proceed in 
accordance with normal radio failure procedure. 
4.1.4.  if by day, the climb can be made in VMC; there is no need for the pilot to leave controlled airspace 
or an advisory route.  
4.1.5.  Should  it be necessary to cross an airway during the climb, the airway should be crossed at right 
angles at an intermediate 500 ft level. 
 Action by ATC 
As soon as it is known that two-way communication has failed, the appropriate ATC unit shall 
take action in ac cordance with the procedures laid down in the PANS-RAC PART Ill.

 5. AIRCRAFT CATEGORI ZATION 
Aircraft performance has a direct effect on the airspace and visibility needed to perform the various 
maneuveres associated with the conduct of instrument approach procedures. The most significant 
performance factor is aircraft speed.  Accordingly, the following five catego ries of typical aircraft have 
been established based on 1.3 times stall speed in the landing configuration at a maximum certificated landing weight, to provide a standardized basis for relating aircraft man euverability to 
specific instrument approach procedures. 
• Category A less than 91 knots IAS  
• Category B   91 knots or more, but less than 121 kno ts 
• Category C 121 knots or more, but less than 141 knots  
• Category D 141 knots or more, but less than 166 knots  
• Category E 166 knots or more, but less than 211 knots.

 ENR 1.7 ALTIMETER SETTING PROCEDURES  
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
 The Altimeter Setting Procedures in use in Sudan are conforming to those contained in ICAO Doc 
8168 OPS/611  Volume I Part 6.  
 The t ransition altitude in South Sudan is 6,000 ft., unless otherwise stated on the approach plate. 
 QNH reports and temperature information for use in determining adequate terrain clearance are 
available on request from the air traffic services units. QNH values are given in hectopascals 
(hpa).  
 
2. BASIC ALTIMETER SETT ING PROCEDURES  
 General  
2.1.1.  A transition altitude may be  specified for each aerodrome. The t ransition altitude in South Sudan is 
6,000 ft., unless otherwise stated. 
2.1.2.  Vertical positioning of aircraft when at or below the transition altitude is expressed in terms of 
altitude, whereas such positioning at or above the transition level is expressed in terms of flight 
levels. While passing through the transition layer, vertical positioning is expressed in terms of altitude when descending, and in terms of flight levels when climbing. 
2.1.3.  Flight level zero is located at the atmospheric pressure level of 1013,2 hPa (29,92 inches). 
Consecutive flight levels are separated by pressure intervals corresponding to 500 ft (152, 4 m) in 
the standard atmosphere. 
 Take-off and climb 
2.2.1.  A QNH altimeter setting is made available to aircraft in taxi clearance. 
 Vertical Separation - En Route  
2.3.1.  Vertical separation during en-route flight shall be expressed in terms of flight levels at all times 
during an IFR flight  and at night.  
2.3.2.  When complying with the specification of Annex 2 an aircraft at or above 1000 ft above the ground 
or water shall be flown at flight levels corresponding to the magnetic tracks shown in the table of 
cruising levels in Appendix 3 of Annex 2 
2.3.3.  Terrain clearance 
2.3.3.1  Owing, to the scarcity of reporting stations, late QNH altimeter-setting reports cannot be 
provided to enable the determination of the flight level that will ensure terrain clearance. Therefore lowest safe flight levels to afford adequate terrain clearance are based on application 
of the climatologically method. 
2.3.3.2  Such method will permit the application of lowest safe flight levels incorporating a margin of 
safety to cover variations in the actual atmosphere over Sudan. The level nominated shall be that level which in a standard atmosphere lies 500 ft above the minimum safe altitude for the route. For example, if the highest terrain en-route is 10.000 ft, the minimum safe altitude is 11.000 ft and the permanent lowest safe flight level is 115. If this level is inappropriate, the next 
higher level would apply.

  Approach and landing 
2.4.1.  A QNH altimeter setting is made available in approach clearance and clearance to enter the traffic 
circuit. 
2.4.2.  QFE altimeter setting is made available on request. 
2.4.3.  Vertical positioning of aircraft during approach is by reference to flight levels until reaching the 
transition level below which vertical positioning is controlled by reference to altitudes. 
 Missed Approach 
2.5.1.  The relevant portions of 2.1 and 2.2 shall be applied in event of a missed approach. 
 
3. DESCRIPTION OF ALTIM ETER SETTING REGION  
 The altimeter -setting region is the South Sudan FIR. The areas covered by this region are shown on 
the Air Traffic Services Airspace Chart ENR 2. 
 4. PROCEDURES APP LICABLE TO OPERATORS  (INCLUDING PILOTS)  
 Flight planning  
The levels at which a flight is to be conducted shall be specified in a flight plan as follows: a) in terms of flight levels if the flight is to be conducted at or above the transition level, and . . . 
b) in terms of altitudes if the flight is to be conducted in the vicinity of an aerodrome or below the 
transition altitude 
Notes:  1. Short flights in the vicinity of an aerodrome may often be conducted only at altitudes 
below the transition altitude.  
2. Flight levels are specified in a flight plan by number and not in terms of feet or meters,

1. GENERAL  
The following procedures are intended for use by aircraft when unlawful interference occurs and the 
aircraft is unable to notify an ATS unit of this fact.  
2. PROCEDURES  
 Unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise, the pilot-in -command should attempt to 
continue flying on the assigned track and at the assigned cruising level at least until notification to 
an ATS unit is possible. 
 When  an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful interference must depart from its assigned track or 
its assigned cruising level without being able to make radiotelephony contact with ATS, the pilot-
in-command should, whenever possible: 
a) attempt to broadcast warnings on the VHF emergency frequency and other appropriate 
frequencies, unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise.  Other equipment such as on-board transponders, data links, etc. should also be used when It Is advantageous to do so and circumstances permit; and 
b) proceed in accordance with applicable special procedures for in-flight contingencies, where 
such procedures have been established and promulgated in Doc 7030 - Regional 
Supplementary Procedures; or 
c) if no applicable regional procedures have been established, proceed at a level which differs 
from the cruising level normally used for IFR flight in the area by 1000ft (300m ) if above FL 
290 or by 500 ft (150m ) if below FL 290.

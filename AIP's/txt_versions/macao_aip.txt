Civil Aviation Authority – Macao, China  AMDT 34  5.  Friction Measuring device used and fricti on level below which the runway is declared 
slippery when it is wet 
5.1 Runway surface friction at Macao is measured  by means of a Mu-meter. Runs are carried 
out at a speed of 65 km/hour regularly on a dr y runway surface using a self-watering device 
giving a controlled depth of 1 mm of water to monitor the effe ctiveness of the rubber deposit 
removal action and surface wear and tear. Should  the friction value fall to 0.42 or less the 
runway will be notified as liable to be s lippery when wet and the Macau International 
Airport Co. Ltd. (CAM), Airpor t Operations Department s hould initiate the corrective 
actions. 
5.2  If and when such notification is given, th ere may be a significant deterioration both in 
aircraft stopping performance a nd directional control when the runway is wet. Takeoff or 
landing should then be consider ed only if the distances availa ble equal to or exceed those 
required for slippery conditions as determ ined in the Aeroplane Flight Manual. 
5.3  If a pilot experiences  a significant degradation of the br aking action, it should immediately 
be reported to ATC for relay to subsequent  landing aircraft and for follow-up action by 
CAM, Airport Operations Department.

lines at all times. Marshalling service will normally be available to assist pilots in the correct 
positioning of their aircraft whilst parking. 
 Note: Pilots should exercise extreme caution when manoeuvring on th e aprons due to the 
proximity of other aircraft, ground staff and e quipment. Engine power should be restricted 
to the minimum required to reduce the adverse effect of jet blast.  A case in point is the use of 
greater than normal breakaway thrust when ma king the turn from the parking bay to the 
taxiway centreline. Pilots s hould restrict the power sett ing to the absolute minimum 
necessary to execute the turn.

lead-in line shall be followed. 
THE PILOT MUST NOT PROCEED BEYOND THE BRIDGE, 
UNLESS THE ARROWS HA VE BEEN SUPERSEDED BY THE CLOSING RATE BAR. 
3 TRACKING 
When the aircraft has been caught by the laser, the floating arrow is replaced by the yellow center line indicator. 
A flashing red arrow indicates the direction to turn. 
The vertical yellow arrow shows position in relation to the center 
line. This indicator gives corre ct position and azimuth guidance. 
4 CLOSING RATE 
The closing rate is the final c ountdown from a specific distance 
to the stop position. A yellow vertical closing rate bar/center line indicator appears with or without  a digital countdown, depending 
on the configuration.

bottom upwards) and as the last row turns off, less than the 
interval for one row remains until STOP appears.  
A digital countdown shows the distance to stop numerically, 
starting from 30 m.  
The digital countdown also uses different decrements during the 
closing rate process.  
• Metric digital count starting with 1 meter decrements from 30 
m down to 2 m followed by 0.2 meter decrements from 2.0 down 
to 0.2 m and then followed  by STOP.  
The pictures illustrate aircraft in the closing rate distance from 
stop position, slightly left of the center line. The red arrow 
indicates the direction to steer.  Meters (m)  
5 ALIGNED TO CENTRE  
The aircraft is at the displayed distance from t he stop position. 
The absence of any direction arrow indicates an aircraft on the 
center line.  
 
Meters (m)  
6 SLOW (DECREASE SPEED)  
A VDGS is configured with a slowdown active zone (distances 
set from the stop position, between 6 to 24 meters) according t o 
an acceptable docking speed (max allowed speed, 2 m/s).  
Note: When 2 m/s is rounded down to a single digit, it is 
approximately 7 km/h, 4 mph or 3 knots.  
If the aircraft is approaching faster than the accepted speed, the 
system will show ‘SLOW ’ or ‘SLO W DOWN’  as a warning to 
the pilots.  
 
Meters (m)  
7 AZIMUTH GUIDANCE  
The aircraft is at the displayed distance from the stop -position. 
The yellow arrow indicates an aircraft to the right of the center

4.1 Normally engine runs above ground idle power are not permitted during the critical hours of 
2200 to 0700 local time. Exception may be co nsidered case by case, depending on actual 
operational analyses (e.g. time needed for engine run-up, expected movements, etc). 
4.2 Engine Ground Run Procedures 
4.2.1 An engine ground run is define d as any engine start up not associated with the planned 
aircraft departure. Maintenance or test running of jet engine not mounted on an aircraft is 
prohibited unless performed in a test cell of adequate design. 
4.2.2 Normally, engine ground running at idle pow er for duration not exceeding 15 minutes may 
be conducted on aircraft parking bays with pr evious coordination with Airport Operation 
Coordination Centre (AOCC). Extension of such limitation is subject to AOCC approval 
depending on airport conditions. Power runs ab ove idle for maintenance purpose must be 
conducted at designated areas.  
4.2.3 Initial requests for a ground run at any time should be made by telephone to Airport

REMARK:   
(1) Aircraft are NOT TO OVERSHOOT JIUZHOU DVOR (ZAO 117.2 MHz) R23 1° which defines the northern limit 
for flights taking off RWY 34 due to NOISE ABATEMENT for Zhuhai City.  
(2) Aircraft unable to comply with the minimum climb gradient must inform Macao ground control at first contact to 
allow special coordination.  
(3) Maximum departure turning speed: 205 kt IAS.  
(4) Owing to the proximity of the Hong Kong international airport, any devia tion from the standard SID track could  
result in direct conflict with Hong Kong traffic. Pilots departing on RWY 34 are reminded the need to follow the  
standard SID track until LATOP unless deviation is approved by ATC in advance .

REMARK:  
(1) For RNA V (GNSS)  SID aircraft must be approved by State of Registry in accordan ce with ICAO RNP1 standard or 
equivalent. Carriage of certified GNSS receiver is mandatory. 
(2) Aircraft that do not have approval or whose RNP1/ P-RN A V capability has been degraded before departure shall 
use the Conventional Departure Procedure: 
 
Depart on track 359°M and climb to 400 ft (120 m). Then turn right and continue climb to ZAO. Leave ZAO on 
R041°. Cross MCU 12.5 NM at or above 1200 m (3937 ft) and turn right to track 081°M to MC411. From MC411 
continue in accordance with the procedures as per HK AIP or expect radar vectors by Hong Kong ATC to ALLEY,  
CONGA, GRUPA or NUDPI.   
 
If ZAO is unserviceable, depart on track 359 M, at MCU DME 3.3 turn right on track 041 M. Cross MCU 13.1 
NM at or above 1200 m (3937 ft) and turn right to track 081°M to MC411. From MC411 continue in accordance 
with the procedures as per HK AIP or ex pect radar vectors by Hong Kong ATC to ALLEY,  CONGA, GRUPA or 
NUDPI.   
 
(3) Aircraft are NOT TO OVERSHOOT ZAO DVOR R231° which defines the northern limit for flights taking off 
RWY 34 due to NOISE ABATEMENT for Zhuhai City. 
(4) Procedure Design Gradient based only on airspace restriction.  
(5) Aircraft unable to comply with the minimum climb gradie nt must inform MACAO ground control at first contact to 
allow special coordination. 
(6) Maximum departure turning speed: 205 kt IAS until directing to LATOP.   
(7) Aircraft shall fly at 250 kt or less below FL 110 transiting Hong Kong Airspace 
(8) In the event of loss of communication, aircraft shall comply with the last acknowledged clearance up to the next 
reporting point in the SID, then climb to the flight planned cruising level and follow the flight planned route to join 
the appropriate airway. 
(9) Owing to the proximity of the Hong Kong International Airport, any deviation from the standard SID track could 
result in direct conflict with Hong Kong traffic. Pilots  departing on RWY 34 are reminded the need to follow the 
standard SID track until LUKBU unless deviation is approved by ATC in advance.

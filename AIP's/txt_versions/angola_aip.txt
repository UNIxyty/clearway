1 UNITS OF MEASUREMENT 
The table of units of measurement shown below will be used by aeronautical Station within Luanda FIR 
for air and ground operations. 
For measurement of Units used 
Distance used in navigation, position reporting, etc – generally in excess of 
2 nautical miles. 
Nautical Miles and tenths 
Relatively short distances such as those relating to aerodromes (e.g. 
runway lengths). 
Meters 
Altitudes, elevations and heights Feet 
Horizontal speed including wind speed Knots 
Vertical speed Feet per minute 
Wind direction for landing and taking off Degrees Magnetic 
Wind direction except for landing and taking off Degrees True 
Visibility including runway visual range Kilometers or meters 
Altimeter setting Hectopascal 
Temperature Degrees Celsius 
Weight Metric tonnes or Kilogrammes 
Time Hours and minutes, beginning at midnight UTC 
2 Time System 
 
General Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is used by air navigation services and publication issued by 
the Aeronautical information service. Reporting of time is expressed to the nearest minute, e.g 12:40:35 
is reported as 12:41. 
 
Local time in Angola is UTC plus one hour. 
 
3 Geodetic reference datum 
 
3.1 Name/designation of datum 
 
All published geographical coordinates indicating latitude and longitude are expressed in terms of the 
World Geodetic System -1984 (WGS-84) geodetic reference datum. 
 
3.2 Area of application 
 
The area of application for the published geographical coordinates coincides with the area of 
responsibility of the aeronautical information service, i.e. the entire territory of Angola as well as the 
airspace over the high seas encompassed by the Luanda Flight Information Region in accordance with 
the regional air navigation agreement. 
 
3.3 Use of an asterisk to identify published geographical coordinates 
 
An asterisk (*) will be used to identify those published geographical coordinates which have not been 
transformed into WGS-84 geodetic reference datum.

GEN 3.3  AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES 
 
1 Responsible service 
 
Empresa Nacional de Exploração e Navegação Aérea (ENANA) is the responsible authority for the provision 
of air traffic services, acting under supervision of the National Institute of Civil Aviation.  
 
In general the air traffic rules and procedures in force and the organisation of air traffic services are in 
conformity with ICAO Standards, Recommended Practices and Procedures. Differences between the national 
and international rules and procedures will be inserted in due time. 
 
2 Area of responsibility 
 
Air traffic services are provided for the entire territory of Angola, including territorial waters as well as in the 
airspace over the high seas encompassed by Angola FIR/UIR. 
The airspace of Angola territory, including adjacent international waters comprise single FIR (Luanda FIR)  
 
3 Types of services 
 
3.1 The following types of services are provided:  
 
− Approach Control service; 
− Area Control Service; 
− Flight Information Services; 
− Alerting Services. 
 
3.2 With the exception of services provided at military air bases, the following types of services are 
provided at aerodromes:  
 
− Aerodrome Control Service; 
− Aerodrome Flight Information Service 
 
4 Co-ordination between the operator and ATS 
 
Co-ordination between the operator and air traffic services is effected in accordance with 2.1.5 of ICAO Annex 
11 
 
5 Minimum flight altitude 
 
The minimum flight altitudes on the ATS routes as listed in ENR 3.1 and 3.2 have been determined so as to 
ensure at least 300m (1000FT) vertical clearance above the highest obstacle within 10nm on each side of the 
centre line of the route or 600m (2000 FT) above mountainous area. However, where the angular divergence 
of navigational aid signal, in combination with the distance between the navigation aids, could result in an 
aircraft being more than 8Km on either side of the centre line, the 18Km protection limit is increased by the 
extent to which the divergence is more than 8Km from the centre line.

8.2       Area meteorological watch service 
 
The area meteorological watch service is performed by Luanda Meteorological Watch Office (MWO). 
The MWO issues information in the form of SIGMET and AIRMET messages about the occurrence or expected 
occurrence of one or several of the following significant meteorological phenomena: 
− thunderstorms1  
− severe turbulence 
− severe icing 
 
The SIGMETs are issued in abbreviations and plain language using ICAO abbreviations and are numbered consecutively 
for each day commencing at 0001. Their period of validity is generally limited to less than 4 hours from the time of 
transmission. 
 
The MWO transmit SIGMETs issued by themselves, as well as SIGMET of adjacent MWOs and, upon agreement, also 
SIMETs of other MWOs, to the regional control centre competent for the FIR or the UIR. 
 
In addition to the issuance of SIGMETs, the MWO will inform the area control centre/flight information centre about the 
occurrence or expected occurrence of thu nderstorms or moderate turbulence within Luanda FIR. The information is 
intended for the safety of low level flights and is limited to the lower airspace. 
 
8.3  Warning service 
 
Warnings for the protection of parked and moored aircraft or of other equipment at the airport are issued by all aerodrome 
meteorological offices, if one or several of the following phenomena are expected to occur at the airport: 
− hunderstorm 
− hail 
− heavy rain 
− freezing precipitation 
 
Differences from these criteria have to be agreed upon locally. 
 
The warnings are generally issued in English and are distributed in accordance with a distribution list witch has to be 
agreed upon locally. In order to guarantee rapid dissemination of the warnings, the distribution list to be used shall, as far 
as possible, contain only one recipient for an interested group, this recipient will be responsible for the further 
dissemination of the warning within the group. 
 
SIGMET information is disseminated, in addition to directed transmissions to aircraft general calls, as an aeronautical or 
radio broadcast H24:  
 
a) For Luanda FIR, by the Area Control Centre 
b) by the ATS units for their own area of responsibility. 
 
The information is broadcasted from the MWO concerned and repeated every half full hour during the period of validity of 
the SIGMET information.

8 PROCEDURES 
 
8.1 General 
 
There are no aircraft specifically established for search action in the Angola SRR, however the Air Force will 
provide such aircraft as and when available for search and rescue purpose in Angola whenever this becomes 
necessary. Certain of these aircraft are equipped for air dropping of survival packs.  
 
Arrangements have also been made with Police, Army and other local authorities concerned with the 
organization of ground search parties as circumstances may require. 
 
8.2 Initiation of search action and advice to occupants of aircraft 
 
Whenever an aircraft flying within the Angola SRR: 
 
a) Fails to arrive within 30 minutes  of the ETA last notified to, or estimated by ATS units:  
 
Note: If search and rescue service is not required or if it is impossible to notify ATS about landing 
within the stipulated time, make a note in the flight plan in item 18 "no SAR".  
b) Fails to communicate an ATS unit within a period of 30 minutes after the time of a scheduled position 
report or "Operations Normal" report should have been transmitted, from the time an unsuccessful 
attempt to establish communication with such aircraft was first made. Overdue action is immediately 
initiated followed by search rescue operation, if necessary. 
 
Checks are made at all aerodromes and landing groups along the route, and if these fail to locate the position, 
concentrated search by aircraft and ground parties will be undertaken. 
 
8.3 Procedures for pilot in command intercepting a distress call and/or message. 
 
Whenever a distress call and/ or message is intercepted on radio telephony by a pilot in command of an 
aircraft, other than a search aircraft he shall: 
a) plot the position of the aircraft in distress if given; 
b) if possible take a bearing on the transmission; 
c) at his discretion while awaiting instructions proceed to the position given in the distress signal.  
 
REMARK:  
In addition, compliance is required with communication procedures. 
 
8.4 Procedures for pilot in command observing an accident. 
 
8.4.1 When pilot in command observes that another craft is in distress, he/she shall, unless is unable or the 
circumstances of the case, consider it unreasonable or unnecessary: 
 
a) Keep in sight the craft in distress until such time as his/her presence is no longer necessary or until 
he/she is no longer able to remain in the vicinity of the distressed craft; 
b) If his/her position is not known with certainty, take such action as will facilitate the determination of it;  
c) report to the Rescue Coordination Centre or Air Traffic Unit  
Services units as much of the following information is possible: 
− Type of aircraft in distress, its identification and condition; 
− Its position, expressed in geographical coordinates or in distance and the true bearing from a 
distinctive landmark or from a radio navigation aid; 
− Time of observation expressed in UTC on the 24 hours system; 
− Number of persons observed; 
− Whatever persons have been seen to abandon the aircraft in distress; 
− Apparent physical condition of survivors. 
 
d) Act as instructed by the Rescue Co-ordination Center or appropriate ATS unit.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
8.5 Communication 
 
8.5.1 Transmission and acceptance of distress messages within the Angola Search and Rescue Region are handled in 
accordance with Chapter 5 of Annex 10 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. 
 
8.5.2 For communication during search and rescue operations, the codes and Abbreviations published in ICAO 
Abbreviations and Codes (Doc 8400) are used. 
 
8.5.3 The aeronautical telecommunication station serving the aeronautical mobile service maintain a continuous 
listening watch on their stated frequencies during the published hours of service and will accept and relay, if necessary, 
any distress message. The frequency 121.5 MHz guarded continuously during the hours of service at Luanda ACC and 
FIC. 
 
8.5.4 Aircraft engaged in SAR operations may use the prefix PLAYMATE in addition to the normal call sign on RTF. 
Pilot hearing an aircraft giving this call sign shall maintain RTF silence except in an emergency until such time as it is clear 
no further message are being immediately passed to or from the aircraft. 
 
9 Automatic Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELBA/ELT) 
 
9.1 General 
 
9.1.1 It is mandatory for all aircraft registered in Angola to be equipped with an automatic type emergency transmitter 
(ELT). 
 
9.1.2 If the aircraft is equipped with a functioning ELT this shall be shown in the ATS flight plan, item 19 by not crossing 
out the letters R/and E. 
 
9.1.3 If the ELT has RTF capacity and can be used a portable emergency radio set, this should be shown by not 
crossing out the relevant letter(s) U for UHF 243 Mhz, V for VHF 121.5 Mhz. 
 
9.2 ELT testing 
 
ELT tests are authorized during the first 5 minutes after any hour. Test must be longer than 3 audible sweeps or 1 second. 
In exceptional cases, test may be carried out outside this 5 minutes time frame, provided special permission as been 
obtained from the nearest ATS Unit. Airborne tests are not authorized. 
 
10 Training Operations 
 
10.1 Transmission from ELT approved for training purposes (121.875 and 243.750 MHz) may take place without 
special permission. 
 
11 Training Operations 
 
11.1 False ELT Alarms 
 
11.1.1 Great caution should be exercised to prevent the inadvertent activation of ELT in the air or while they are being 
handled on the ground. Accidental or unauthorized activation will generate an ELT signal leading to unnecessary search 
action. 
 
A false ELT alarm could also interfere with genuine emergency transmissions and hinder or delay the timely location of 
accident sites. Furthermore, frequent false alarms could result in complacency and decrease the vigorous reaction that 
must be attached to all ELT signals. The risk of false ELT alarms can be minimized by monitoring 121.5 MHz: 
a) in flight, whenever practicable; 
b) prior to engine shut-down at the end of each flight; 
c) when the ELT is handled during installation or maintenance; 
d) when maintenance is being performed in the vicinity of ELT and; 
e) when the aircraft is moved by ground crew.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
11.1.2 If an ELT signal is heard, check if your own ELT is transmitting inadvertently by momentarily turning it 
off or listening on some frequencies around 121.5MHZ. (A signal from your own ELT is transmitting, turn it off 
if possible, and notify the nearest ATS unit about the inadvertent ELT transmission including the time and 
position .This is absolutely necessary, since every alarm must be considered genuine until proven otherwise, 
see 12.2 below. 
 
12 Listening watch on 121.5 MHZ and ELT Reporting Procedures 
 
12.1 To make optimal use of the system, it is essential that signals transmitted be heard and reported as 
soon as possible. Therefore, pilots are encouraged to monitor the frequency 121.5 MHz in flight.  
 
12.2 Whenever practicable with regard to other necessary radio communication (ref. Annex 10 volume II 
paragraph 5.2.2.1.1.2) 
 
12.3 Upon receiving an ELT signal, carry out the check described in 11.1 above. If signal is established to 
originate from any other ELT, notify ATS immediately. To the extent possible, report your own position and 
level when the signal was first heard, and, eventually, when signal was at maximum strength, and when it was 
last heard. 
 
 
Remark: If the aircraft has homing equipment, provide the bearing to the emergency signal with each reported 
position

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
6.1.2 No clearance shall be given to execute any manoeuvre that would reduce the spacing between two 
aircraft to less than the separation minimum applicable in the circumstances.  
6.1.3 Larger separations than specified minima should be applied whenever wake turbulence or exceptional 
circumstances such as unlawful interference call for extra precautions. This should be done with due 
regard to all relevant factors so as to avoid impending the flow of air traffic by the application of 
excessive separations. 
 
6.2 The vertical Separation Minimum 
 
6.2.1 The Vertical Separation Minimum (VSM) within Luanda FIR is 300 m (1000ft) below FL 290 and 600m 
(2000ft) at or above this level. 
6.2.2 Vertical Separation during ascent or descent. 
a) Pilots in direct communication with each other may, with their concurrence, be cleared to maintain a 
specified vertical separation between their aircraft during ascent or descent.  
6.3 Horizontal Separation 
 
6.3.1 Lateral separation of aircraft at the same level is obtained by requiring operation on different routes or in 
different geographical locations as determined by visual observation, by use of navigation aids or by use 
of satellite based navigation equipment. 
6.3.2 Lateral separation may be achieved by means of the following: 
1) Geographical separation, i.e. separation positively indicated by position reports over different geographical 
locations as determined visually or by reference to a navigation aid. 
2) Track separation between aircraft using the same navigation aid or method. 
3) By requiring aircraft to fly on specified tracks which are separated by a minimum amount appropriate to the 
navigation aid or method employed as follows: 
a) VOR: at least 20 degrees and at a distance of 37 Km (20 NM) or more from the facility. 
b) NDB: at least 30 degrees and at a distance of 37 Km (20 NM) or more from the facility. 
c) Dead reckoning (DR); Separation is deemed to exist when tracks diverging by at least 45 degrees and at 
a dist ance of 37 Km (20 NM) or more from the point of intersection of the tracks, this point being 
determined either visually or by reference to a navigation aid. 
6.4 Longitudinal separation 
Longitudinal separation shall be applied so that the spacing between the estimated positions of the 
aircraft being separated is never less than a prescribed minimum. 
Longitudinal separation shall be established by requiring aircraft to depart at a specified time, to lose 
time to arrive over a geographical location at a specified time, or to hold over a geographical location 
until a specified time. 
Longitudinal time separation normally applied between aircraft at the same level on the same track in 
Luanda FIR is 20 minutes. 
Longitudinal separation minima based on the mach number technique: 
Jet aircraft shall maintain the mach number approved by ATC and shall obtain previously clearance 
from ATC prior any change thereof. If it is essential any temporary change of mach number (e.g. due to 
turbulence), the ATC shall be notified immediately after the change is made.  
If due to aircraft performance it is not possible to maintain the last assigned mach number during the 
climb or descent enroute, the pilot shall inform the ATC upon requesting clearance to climb or descend.  
The mach number technique is applicable as follows: 
a) All aircraft involved shall report passed over the same reporting point and are following the same track or 
continuously diverging tracks, until another form of separation is assured, or 
b) If the aircraft did not report over the same reporting point, it is possible to establish by radar or another effective 
means, an appropriate time interval from the last common point from which they will be following the same track 
or continuously diverging tracks;

The longitudinal separation minima between jet aircraft flying on the same track, maintaining cruising level, 
climbing or descending, will be: 
Ten minutes, or  
Nine to five minutes if: 
The preceding aircraft is maintaining a faster mach number than the following aircraft the required separation 
shall be according the table below: 
1) Nine minutes if the preceding aircraft is maintaining a mach number 0,02 faster than the following. 
2) Eight minutes if the preceding aircraft is maintaining a mach number 0,03 faster than the following.  
3) Seven minutes if the preceding aircraft is maintaining a mach number 0,04 faster than the followi ng. 
4) Six minutes if the preceding aircraft is maintaining a mach number 0,05 faster than the following.  
5) Five minutes if the preceding aircraft is maintaining a mach number 0,06 faster than the following.  
Once the minimum of ten minutes longitudinal separation based on the mach number technique is provided, 
the preceding aircraft shall maintain a mach number equal or faster than the following.  
Note: In all other cases the separation minima shall be as prescribed in PANS-ATM (ICAO Doc 4444-ATM 501/12 Chapter V).

g) Land if possible within 30 minutes after the last acknowledged expected approach time or estimated time of 
arrival specified in c). 
h) If unable to land within the time interval specified in g) above, leave the area to land with visual reference in a 
suitable aerodrome, then communicate to the appropriate ATS unit by the most expeditious means. 
The provision of air traffic control service to other flights operating in the airspace concerned will be based on the 
assumption that an aircraft expected to maintain last assigned and acknowledged cruising level(s) to the point(s) specified 
in the clearance and thereafter the cruising level(s) in the current flight plan. 
If the radio communication failure occurs before the aircraft has establish RTF contact with any ATS unit, the pilot flying 
above FL195 shall select and maintain a VFR flight level according to the semi-circular rule applicable to the magnetic 
track of the aircraft. 
The provision of air traffic control service to other flight operating in the airspace concerned will be based on the 
assumption that an aircraft experiencing radio communication failure will comply with the above. 
 
If the radio communication failure occurs when the aircraft is flying to Luanda airport, the pilot in command shall after reach 
the terminal navigational aid (VNA/LU), intercept and proceed to the radial/track 270º, fly outbound during five minutes and 
then start descend to the transition altitude, make a right turn to return to the navigational aid and start the instrument 
approach procedure for landing. 
 
All aircrafts operating inside Luanda (FNAN) FIR must carry at least 1 set of operative radios for radiotelephony, which 
enable the pilot to establish two way communication with ATS on the notified frequencies.

ENR 1.7  ALTIMETER SETTING PROCEDURES 
 
1. Introduction 
The altimeter setting procedures in use generally conform to those contained in ICAO Doc 8168 Vol. I, 
Part 6 and are given full bellow. 
Transition altitudes for all aerodromes are given in the tabulation in AD.  
QNH reports and temperature information for use in determining adequate terrain clearance is available 
on request from air traffic service units. QNH values are given in whole hectopascals.  
2. Basic Altimeter Setting Procedures 
2.1  General 
1) A transition altitude is specified for each aerodrome. No transition altitude is less than 900 meters 
above aerodrome. 
2) Vertical positioning of aircraft at or below the transition altitude is expressed in terms of altitude. 
Whereas, such positioning at or above the transition level is expressed in terms of flight levels. 
While passing through the transition layer, vertical positioning is expressed in terms of altitude 
when descending, and in terms of flight levels when ascending. 
3) Flight level zero is located at the atmospheric pressure level of 1013.2 hPa (29.92 inches). 
Consecutive flight levels are separated by a pressure interval corresponding to 500 feet (152.4 
meters) in the Standard Atmosphere. 
REMARK:  
 
Examples of the relationship between flight levels and altimeter indications are given in the following table, the 
metric equivalents being approximate: 
 
Flight level number  Altimeter indication  
Feet  Metres  
10 1 000 300 
15 1 500 450 
20 2 000 600 
50 5 000 1 000 
100 10 000 3 050 
150 15 000 4 440 
200 20 000 5 001 
 
2.2 Take-off and climb 
2.2.1 A QNH altimeter setting is made available to aircraft in taxi clearance prior to take- off. 
2.2.2 2.2.2 Vertical positioning of aircraft during climb is expressed in terms of altitudes until reaching the 
transition altitude above which vertical positioning is expressed in terms of flight levels . 
2.3 Vertical separation — en route 
2.3.1 Vertical separation during en-route flight shall be expressed in terms of flight levels at all times “during 
an IFR flight and at night”. 
2.3.2 IFR flights, and VFR flights above 900 m (3 000 ft), when in level cruising flight, shall be flown at such 
flight levels, corresponding to the magnetic tracks shown in the following table, so as to provide the 
required terrain clearance:

Except when, on the basis of regional air navigation agreements, a modified table of cruising levels based on a nominal vertical 
separation minimum of 300 m (1 000 ft) is prescribed for use, under specified conditions, by aircraft operating above FL 410 within 
designated portions of the airspace. 
Magnetic track, or in polar areas at latitudes higher than 70 degrees and within such extensions to those areas as may be prescribed 
by the appropriate ATS authorities, grid tracks as determined by a network of lines parallel to the Greenwich Meridian superi mposed 
on a polar stereographic chart in which the direction towards the North Pole is employed as the Grid North.  
9 Application of Semi-Circular Rules 
All cruising flights levelled at more than 3000 ft above terrain whether VFR or IFR should maintain an 
appropriate level in accordance with the semi-circular system of flight levels. 
Within controlled airspace, it may be necessary for the appropriate ATC unit to assign levels other 
than semi-circular system levels in order to ensure minimum standard separation. 
When compliance with VFR can not be maintained at an appropriate level, an aircraft may be flown at 
a more suitable level provided that the appropriate ATS unit notified about the intention to change, or 
when within controlled airspace, a clearance is obtained.

1. Procedures for the submission of a flight plan 
A flight plan shall be submitted to ATC by the pilot-in-command or the operator in respect of the 
following flights:  
a) any flight or portion thereof to be provided with air traffic control service;  
b) flights on all controlled airspaces whether IFR or VFR;  
c) any flight within or into designated areas, or along designated routes, when so required by the 
appropriate ATS authority to facilitate the provision of flight information, alerting and search 
and rescue services; 
d) any flight within or into designated areas, or along designated routes, when so required by the 
appropriate ATS authority to facilitate co-ordination with appropriate military units or with air 
traffic services units adjacent states in order to avoid the possible need of interception for the 
purpose of identification; 
e) any flight engaged in public services; 
f) any flight across international borders. 
 
1.2 Time of submission 
 
The flight plan shall be submitted by the pilot-in-command, the operator or its representative at least

telephone or by any communication means available to the nearest ATS unit; 
c) In the event of a delay of thirty (30) minutes in excess of the estimated off-block time, the flight 
plan for any aircraft intending to depart for an international flight should be amended, or a new 
flight plan submitted and the old flight plan canceled, whichever is applicable.  
d) For aircrafts engaged in domestic flights the time mentioned in c) above is extended to one (1) 
hour. 
2.3 Cancellation of an IFR flight plan 
a) A pilot-in-command may change from IFR flight plan to a VFR flight plan by reporting

2.5 Except as prescribed in the following paragraph, the pilot-in-command shall ensure that the aircraft 
adheres to the current flight plan filed for a controlled flight unless a request for change has been made 
and accepted by ATC unit having jurisdition over the controlled airspace in wihch the aircraft as operating 
or unless an emergency situation arises which necessitates immediate action in which event, the 
responsible air traffic control unit shall, as soon as circumstances permit, be notified of the action taken 
and that this action was taken under emergency authority. 
 
2.6 In the event that a controlled flight inadvertently deviates it's current flight plan, the following action shall 
be taken: 
a) If the aircraft is off track, action shall be taken forthwith to adjust the heading of the aircraft to 
regain track as soon as practicable; 
b) If the average true airspeed at cruising level between reporting points varies or is expected to vary 
from that given in the flight plan, by plus or minus 5 percent of the true airspeed, from that given in 
the flight plan, the appropriate air traffic services units shall be so informed as soon as possible.  
c) If the estimated time at the next applicable reporting point, flight information region boundary or 
destination aerodrome, whichever comes first, is found to be in error in excess of three (3) 
minutes from that notified to air traffic services, a revised estimate time shall be notified to the 
responsible air traffic services unit as soon as possible. 
 
2      Repetitive flight plan system 
2.1
   General 
The procedures concerning the use of Repetition Flight Plans (RPL) conform to ICAO Doc 7030 and the 
PANS-RAC, 12th edition, RPL lists relating to flights out of and over flying the Luanda FIR shall be 
submitted at least two weeks in advance, in duplicate, to the following address:  
Postal address: 
Air Traffic Services Repotting Office 
P.O.BOX 841 
Luanda Angola 
Fax: 244-2-350678 
AFS: FNLUZPZX 
Email: enana@snet.ca.ao  
 
RPL lists shall be replaced in their entirely by new lists prior to the introduction of the summer and winter 
schedules. RPL will not be valid for any flight unless all ATC authority concerned with the flight plan 
agreed to accept it. 
 
2.2 Incidental changes and cancellation of RPL relating to departures from Angola aerodromes shall be 
notified as early as possible and not later than 30 minutes before departure from Luanda on Tel.244- 2-
350678. Permanent changes to RPL require the submission of a new RPL, so as to reach the AIS Office 
at least 7 days prior to the change becoming effective. 
 
2.3 Delay 
 
When a specific flight is likely to encounter a delay of 30 minutes or more in excess of the departure time 
stated in the RPL, the ATS unit serving the departure aerodrome shall be notified immediately. Delays 
relating to departures from aerodromes shall be notified to Luanda Air Traffic -Services Reporting Office 
and the procedures mentioned in item 3 below shall be applied. 
 
REMARK: 
Failure to comply with these procedures may result in the automatic cancellation of the RPL for that 
specific flight at one or more of the ATS units concerned. 
2.4 ATS messages 
For a flight operated on a RPL, no flight Plan Message (FPL) will be transmitted. Departure messages 
(DEP) or delay messages (DLA) relating to such flights will not be transmitted to ATS units outside the 
Luanda FIR.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
3 Changes to the submitted Flight Plan 
 
3.1 All changes to a flight plan submitted for an IFR flight or controlled VFR flight shall be reported as soon as 
possible to the appropriate ATS unit; 
 
3.2 In the event of a delay in departure: 
a) before the expiry of the above time, (Item 2-3) the operator can request directly from Luanda 
ATS Reporting Office to amend the first departure time at least 1 hour in advance and another 
30 minutes delay may be accepted; 
b) In all cases flight plan will be automatically canceled 3 hours after the first departure time and a 
new flight plan is duly required. 
REMARK: 
 If a delay in departure of a controlled flight is not properly reported, the relevant flight plan data may no 
longer be readily available to the appropriate ATS unit when a clearance is ultimately requested, which 
will consequently result in extra delay for the flight. 
 
3.3 Whenever a flight, for which a flight plan has been submitted, is canceled, the appropriate ATS unit shall 
be informed immediately. 
 
3.4 Changes to a current flight plan for a controlled flight during flight shall be reported or requested, subj ect to 
the provisions in ICAO Annex 2, 3.6.2 (Adherence to flight plan.).

ENR 1.12               INTERCEPTION OF CIVIL AIRCRAFT 
REMARK: 
The word interception in this context does not include intercept and escort service provided, to an aircraft in distress, 
in accordance with the Search and rescue Manual (Doc. 7373). 
1. General 
 
1.1 The following interception procedures and visual signals apply within the territory of Angola in the event of interception 
of an aircraft.  
 
1.2 Interception of an aircraft may have to be undertaken for the purpose of identification or navigational guidance, when 
no other method is available. Such an interception will be carried out by military aircraft in the following procedures 
referred to as "intercepting aircraft" 
 
2 Identification 
When considered necessary by the appropriate military unit as last resource and for the purpose of identification, an 
aircraft may be intercepted. Normally, the following interception method, confirming to the recommended procedure 
laid down in ICAO Annex 2, Attachment A, will be applied. 
 
Phase I- The intercepting aircraft will approach the intercepted aircraft from astern and normally take up a position on 
the left side of the intercepted aircraft, at the same level, not closer than 300 m, and within view of the pilot of the 
intercepted aircraft. After speed and position have be en established, the intercepting aircraft will, if necessary, 
proceed with Phase II of the procedure. 
 
Phase II- The intercepting aircraft will close in gently on the intercepted aircraft at the same level, stopping a distance 
no closer than absolutely necessary to obtain the information needed. The intercepting aircraft will use every possible 
precaution to avoid starting the flight crew or the passengers of the intercepted withdraw form the vicinity of the 
intercepted aircraft as outlined in Phase III. 
Phase III - The intercepting aircraft will break away the intercepted aircraft in a shallow dive. During the whole 
procedure, any other participing aircraft will remain well clear of intercepted aircraft, normally above and behind. 
 
3 Action by intercepted aircraft 
3.1 An aircraft which is intercepted by another aircraft shall immediately: 
a) follow the instruction given by the other aircraft intercepting and responding to visual signals in accordance with 
the specification on GEN 3.6-3 and 3.6-4; 
b) notify, if possible, the appropriate air 
c) traffic services units; 
d) attempt to establish radio communication with the intercepting aircraft or with the appropriate intercept control 
unit, by making a general call on the frequency 121.5 MHz, giving the identity of the intercepted aircraft and the 
nature of the flight; if no contact has been established and if applicable, repeat this call on the emergency 
frequency 243 MHz; 
REMARK:  
The following call sign should be used: 
Intercepting aircraft: INTERCEPTOR + (tail number if readable)  
Intercept control unit: INTERCEPT CONTROL  
Intercepted aircraft: INTERCEPTED AIRCRAFT+ (Identification) 
 
3.2 If any instructions received by radio from any sources conflict with those given by the intercepting aircraft by visual 
signals or by radio, the intercepted aircraft shall request immediate clarification while continuing to comply with the 
visual or radio instruction given by the intercepting aircraft, respectively. 
4 Guidance procedures 
REMARK:  
The term guidance interception denotes interception of aircraft by intercepting aircraft for the purpose of providing 
navigational guidance. 
 
4.1 If following the identification manoeuvres in phase I and II above, it is considered necessary to intervene in the 
navigation of intercepted aircraft, this will, if practicable, be carried out by radio (directly between the intercepting 
aircraft and intercepted aircraft, or via ATS). If this is not practicable, the intervention will be carried out by the 
intercepting aircraft, applying to the following method, conforming to ICAO Annex 2 Attachment A. 
 
The intercepting aircraft will take up position, normally, to the left of and slightly forward of the intercepted aircraft, t o 
enable the pilot of the intercepted aircraft to see the signals given. (Meteorological conditions, terrain, or factors may 
occasionally necessitate taking up a position to the right of the aircraft). 
 
4.2 If radio contact is established during interception but communication in a common language is not possible, attempts 
shall be made to convey instructions, acknowledgement of instructions and essential information by using the phrases 
and pronunciations in the following table:

ENR 1.13                             UNLAWFUL INTERFERENCE 
5 General 
The following procedures are intended for use by aircraft when unlawful interference occurs and the aircraft 
is unable to notify an ATS unit of this fact. 
6 Procedures 
 
2.1 Unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise, the pilot-in-command should attempt to 
continue flying on the assigned track and at the assigned cruising level at least until he is able to notify an 
ATS unit. 
 
2.2 When an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful interference must depart from its assigned track or its 
assigned cruising level without being able to make radiotelephony contact with ATS, the pilot -in-command 
should, whenever possible:  
 
a) attempt to broadcast warnings on the VHF emergency frequency and other appropriate 
frequencies, unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise. Other equipment such as 
on-board transponders, data links, etc., should also be used when it is advantageous to do so and 
circumstances permit; and 
b) proceed in accordance with applicable special procedures for in-flight contingencies, where such 
procedures have been established and promulgated in Doc. 7030-Regional Supplementary 
Procedures; or 
c) if no applicable regional procedures have been established, proceed at a level which differs from 
cruising levels normally used for IFR flights in the area by 300m (1000 FT) if above FL 290 or by 
150m (500 FT) if below FL 290.

ENR 1.14      Air traffic incidents 
 
1 Definition of air traffic incidents 
1.1 Air traffic incident” is used to mean a serious occurrence related to the provision of air traffic 
services, such as:  
a) aircraft proximity (AIRPROX); 
b) serious difficulty resulting in a hazard to aircraft caused, for example, by:  
− faulty procedures 
− non-compliance with facilities; 
− failure of ground facilities. 
 
1.1.1 Definitions for aircraft proximity and AIRPROX.  
 
Aircraft proximity. A situation in which, in the opinion of the pilot or the air traffic services personnel, 
the distance between aircraft, as well as their relative positions and speeds, has been such that the 
safety of the aircraft involved may have been compromised. 
 
1.1.2 Aircraft proximity is classified as follows:  
 
a) Risk of collision. The risk classification of aircraft proximity in which serious risk of collision has 
existed. 
b) Safety not assured. The risk classification of aircraft proximity in which the safety of the aircraft 
may have been compromised. 
 
AIRPROX. The code word used in an air traffic incident report to designate aircraft proximity.  
1.2  Air traffic incidents are designated and identified in reports as follows:  
 
Type Designation 
Air traffic incident Incident 
As a) above Airprox ( aircraft proximity) 
As b) 1) and 2) above Procedure 
As b) 3) above Facility 
 
2  Use of the Air Traffic Incident Report Form (See figures ENR 1.14 Figure 1 to ENR 1.14 Figure 5) 
The Air Traffic Incident Report Form is intended for use:  
a) by a pilot for filing a report on an air traffic incident after arrival or for confirming a report made 
initially by radio during flight. 
REMARK:  
The form, if available on board, may also be of use in providing a pattern for making the initial report in flight; 
b) by an ATS unit for recording an air traffic incident report received by radio, telephone or teleprinter.  
REMARK: The form may be used as the format for the text of a message to be transmitted over the AFS 
network. 
 
3  Reporting procedures (including in flight procedures) 
3.1  The following are the procedures to be followed by a pilot who is or has been involved in an incident:  
3.1.1 during flight, use the appropriate air/ground frequency for reporting an incident of major significance 
particularly if it involves other aircraft, so as to permit the facts to be ascertained immediately;  
3.1.2 as promptly as possible after landing, submit a completed Air traffic incident report form.  
a) for confirming a report of an incident made initially as in a) above, or for making the initial report on 
such an incident if it had not been possible to report it by radio; 
b) for reporting an incident which did not require immediate notification at the time of occurrence.  
3.2  An initial report made by radio should contain the following information: 
a) aircraft identification; 
b) type of incident, e.g. aircraft 
c) proximity; 
d) the incident; 1a) and b); 2.a), b), c); d), n); 3.a), b), c), i); 4.a), b); 
e) miscellaneous: 1.e).

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
3.3  The confirmatory report on an incident of major significance initially reported by radio or the initial report on any other incident should 
be submitted to the Civil Aviation Authority or to the ATS Reporting Office of the aerodrome of first landing for submission to the Civil 
Aviation Authority. The pilot should complete the Air Traffic incident Report Form, supplementing the details of the initial reports as 
necessary. 
 
4  Purpose of reporting and handling of the form 
 
4.1 The purpose of the reporting of aircraft proximity incidents and their investigation is to promote the safety of aircraft. The degree of risk 
involved in an aircraft proximity incident should be determined in the incident investigation and classified as "risk of collision", "safety not 
assured", "no risk of collision" or "risk not determined". 
4.2 The purpose of the form is to provide investigator authorities with as complete information on air traffic incident as possible and to 
enable them to report back, which the least possible delay to the pilot or operator concerned, the result of the investigation of the incident 
and, if appropriate, the remedial action taken.

ENR 5.1              RESTRICTED AIRSPACES AND DANGER AREAS 
 
All air space in which a potentional hazard to aircraft operation may exist and all areas over which the 
operations of civil aircraft may, for one reason or another be restricted either temporarily, or permanently, 
are classified according to the following three types of areas as defined by ICAO. 
 
 Danger Area 
An airspace area of defined dimensions within which activities dangerous to the flight of aircraft may exist 
at specified times. Use of this term is appropriate only when the potential danger to aircraft in flight over 
the area has not led to the designation of an area as restricted or prohibited. The effect of the creation of 
the danger area is to caution operators or pilots or aircraft that it is necessary for them to assess the 
danger in relation to their responsibility for the safety to their aircraft. When the potential danger is within 
or over the land areas of a state or territorial waters adjacent thereto, the State concerned may decide 
that the potential danger can be adequately met by creating a danger area and that is no necessary to 
create a restricted or prohibited area. 
    
Prohibited Area 
An airspace of defined dimensions, above the land areas or territorial waters of a state, within which the 
flight of aircraft is prohibited. Use of this term is appropriate only when the flight of civil aircraft within a 
portion of airspace coming within the scope of definition is not permitted at any time or under any 
circumstances. 
 
Restricted Area 
An airspace of defined dimensions, above the land areas or territorial waters of a state, within which the 
flight of aircraft is prohibited. Use of this term is appropriate only when the flight of civil aircraft  within a 
portion of airspace coming within the scope of definition is not permitted at any time or under any 
circumstances. 
 
This, prohibition of flight except as certain specified time, leads the designation of the airspace as a 
restricted area as would prohibition excepted in certain meteorological obtained conditions. Similarly 
prohibition of flight unless specify permission had been obtained, would lead to the designation of a 
restricted area. However, conditions of flight imposed as a result of application of rules of air traffic 
service practices or procedures (for example, compliance with minimum safe heights or with rules 
stemming from the establishment of controlled airspace) do not constitute conditions calling for 
designation a restricted area. 
 
Each area is numbered and a single series of numbers is used for all areas regardless of type, "R" to 
ensure that a number is never duplicated. 
 
The type of area involved is indicated by the letter "P" for prohibited "R" for restricted and "D" for danger, 
preceded by the nationality letter "FN." For example areas are assigned numbers and letters in the 
following manner FNP1, FNR11, FND7, etc. 
 
  
 
 
The upper and lower are shown in the manner indicated. Altitudes are given in meters.

designated alternate airport, the pilot-in-command shall report the landing as soon as practicable to the international airport at 
which the scheduled landing was to take place. 
1.2.2 This notification may be made through air-ground channels if this method of communication is available, or by telephone or 
telegram. If the pilot-in-command is unable to contact the international airport or designated alternate airport, he shall try to 
inform of his landing to the nearest aerodrome police or military authority. 
1.2.3 In this respect, the pilot-in-command shall be responsible for ensuring that: 
 
1) If permission has not been granted to the aircraft at the previous landing, contact between other persons on the one hand 
and the passengers and crew on the other is avoided;

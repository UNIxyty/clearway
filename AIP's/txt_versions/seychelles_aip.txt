elements of the package are distributed by e- mail. 3.1.3.2  Aeronautical Information Publication  
The AIP is the basic aviation document intended  
primarily to satisfy international requirements for  
exchange of permanent aeronautical information and  
long duration temporary changes essential for air  
navigation. AIP Seychelles is published in one Volume. 
The AIP is published in a loose-leaf form in English
 
for use in international and domestic operations,  
whether the flight is commercial or private one. 
3.1.3.3  Amendment services to the AIP 
(AIP AMDT)  
Amendments to the AIP are made by means of  
replacement sheets. Two types of AIP AMDT are  
produced: 
1.- Regular AIP amendment (AIP AMDT) issued in
accordance with the established regular interval (ref  
GEN 0.1-2) and identified by a plain cover sheet. This  
incorporates permanent changes into the AIP on the  
indicated publication date; and 
2.- AIRAC AIP Amendment (AIRAC AIP  AMDT)
issued in accordance with the AIRAC System and  
identified by plain cover sheet and the acronym –  
AIRAC. This incorporates Operational significant  
permanent changes into the AIP on the indicated  
AIRAC effective date. 
A briefing description of the subjects affected by the  
amendment is given on the AIP Amendment cover  
sheet. New information included on the reprinted AIP  
pages is annotated or identified by a vertical line in the  
margin (or immediately to the left) of the change or

Each AIP page and each AIP replacement page  
introduced by an amendment, including the  
amendment cover sheet are dated. The date consists of  
the day, month, and year of the publication date  
(regular AIP AMDT) or of the AIRAC effective date  
(AIRAC AIP AMDT) of the information. Each AIP amendment cover sheet includes references
 
to the serial number of those elements, if any, of the  
integrated Aeronautical Information Package which  
have been incorporated in the AIP by the amendment  
and are consequently cancelled.

i) rocking the wings; orii) opening and closing the throttle; oriii) changing the propeller pitch.
Note:  Due to high noise level on board surface craft, 
the sound signals in ii) and iii) may be less effective 
than the visual signal in i) and are regarded as 
alternative means of attracting attention. 
c) heading in the direct
ion in which the surface craft
is  to be directed. Repetition of such manoeuvres
has the same meaning.
The following manoeuvres by an aircraft means that 
the assistance of the surface craft to which the signal is 
directed is no longer required: 
a) crossing the wake of the surface craft close astern
at a low altitude and;
b) rocking the wings; or
c) opening and closing the throttle; or
d) changing the propeller pitch.Note:  the following replies may be made by surface 
craft to the signals in  3.6.8.1;  
– For acknowledging receipt of signals: 
1)  the hoisting of the “code pennant”  
(vertical red and white stripes)  
close up (meaning understood); 
2)  the flashing of a succession of “T’s”  
by signal lamp in the Morse  
 code; 
3)  the changing of heading to follow the 
aircraft.  
– For indicating inability to comply: 
1)  the hoisting of the international flag “N” (a 
blue and white checkered square); 
2)  the flashing of a succession of “N’s” in the 
Morse code.

Note 2 : Attention to the above signals may be attracted by other means such as radio, flares, smoke and reflected light. 
3.6.10 Air to ground visual signal code 
The following signals by an aircraft means that the ground signals have been understood: 
a) during the hours of daylight:  -   by rocking the aircraft’s wings;
b) during the hours of darkness: -   by flashing on and off twice the aircraft’s landing lights or, if not so equipped, by
switching on and off twice its navigation lights.

Aircraft shall be equipped with suitable instruments 
and navigation equipment appropriate to the route to be flown. 
1.3.2  Minimum levels 
Except when necessary for take-off or landing or when 
specifically authorized by the Minister, an IFR flight 
shall be flown at a level that is not below the 
minimum flight altitude established by Seychelles or where no such minimum flight altitude has been established,  
a)over high terrain or in mountainous areas, at a
level which is at least  2000 ft (600m) abov

Note: The estimated position of the aircraft will take 
account of the navigation accuracy which can be 
achieved on the relevant route segment, having regard 
to the navigational facilities available on the ground 
and in the aircraft . 
1.3.3  Change from IFR flig ht to VFR flight 
An aircraft electing to change the conduct of its flight 
from compliance with the instrument flight rules to compliance with the visual flight rules shall;  
a) notify th
e appropriate air traffic serv ices unit
specifi
cally that the IFR is cancelled and communicate 
thereto the changes to be made to its current flight plan.  
b) not 
cancel its IFR flight unless it is anticipated and
intended that the flight will be continued for a reasonable period of time in uninterrupted visual meteorological conditions. 
1.3.4  Visual approach 
IFR flights may be cleared to execute visual approaches 
provided the pilot has the destination aerodrome in 
sight and can maintain visual reference to the terrain and; a)t h e  g r o u n d  v i s i b i l i t y  r e p o r t e d  i s  5  k m  o r

procedure indi
cates that the visibility will
permit a visual approach and there is
reasonable assurance th
at the landing can be
accomplished.
1.3.5  Clearances to fly maintaining own separation 
while in VMC 
When so requested by an ai rcraft and pro vided it is 
agreed by the pilot of the other aircraft, an ATC unit may clear a controlled flight, including departing and arriving flights operating in airspaces of Class D  and E 
in VMC during the hours of daylight, to fly subject to 
maintaining own separation to one another and 
remaining in VMC. When a controlled flight is so cleared, the following shall apply: 
a)the clearance shall be for a specified portio
n
of the 
flight at or below 10,000 feet during
climb or descent and subject to furtherrestrictions as 
and when prescribed on the
basis of regional air navigation
 agreement.
b)If there is a possibility that flight under visual
meteorological  conditions may become
impract
icable, an IFR flight shall be provided
with alternative instructions to be complied
with in the event that flight in VMC ca nnot
be maint
ained for the term of the clearance.
c)The pilot of an IFR flight, on observing th at
conditions are
 deteriorating and considerin g
that
 operation in VMC will become
impossible, shall inform ATC before entering
Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC)
and shall proceed with the alternative
instructions given.
Note1 . The provision of vertical and horizontal 
separation by an ATC unit is  not applicable in respect 
of any specified portion of a flight cleared subject to maintaining own separation and remaining in VMC. It is for the flight so cleared to ensure, for the duration 
of the clearance, that it is not operated in such proximity to other flights as to create collision hazard.

Seychelles tower to a sp ecified holding point and 
instructed to contact approach at a specified time, level 
or position. The terms of this clearance shall be adhered to until further instructions are received from Approach Control. If the clearance limi t is reached before further 
instructions have been received, holding procedures shall 
be carried out at the level last authorised. 
b)Due to configuration of the airspace, it is
important that the approaches to the pa
tterns
and 
the holding procedures be carried out as
precisely as possible. Pilots are strongly requestedto inform ATC if for any reason the approachand or holding cannot be performed as requ
ired.

1.8.12 ATS Contingency Procedures 
1.8.12.1 Details regarding applicable ATS contingency plan containing procedures in place to ensure the continued safety 
of air navigation in the event of complete or partial disruptions of air traffic services within the Seychelles Flight 
Information Region are published in AIP Supplement 01/16, dated 22 November 2016. 
1.8.12.2  . 
1.8.13 Operation of Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems(ACAS) 
1.8.13.1 Pilots Responsibilities 
ACAS is intended to serve as a support to visual collision avoidance, application of right-of -way rules and air 
traffic separation services. For ACAS to work as designated, immediate and correct crew response to ACAS 
advisories is essential. Delayed crew response or reluctance of flight crew to adjust the aircraft’s flight path, as 
advised by ACAS due to air traffic control clearance provisions or other operational factors, could significantly 
decrease or negate the protection afforded by ACAS. 
When operating within Seychelles Flight Information region, flight crews are expected to respond to ACAS in 
accordance with the following guidelines: 
a)Respond to TA’s by attempting to establish visual contact with the intruder aircraft and other
aircraft that may be in the vicinity. Coordinate to the degree possible with other crew members
and ATC to assist in searching for the traffic. Do not deviate from an assigned clearance based
only on TA information. For any traffic that is acquired visually, continue to maintain or attain a
safe separation in accordance with current regulations and accepted operating practise.
b)When an RA occurs, the pilot should respond immediately by direct attention to RA displays and
manoeuvre as indicated, unless doing so would jeopardise the safe operation of the flight, or the
flight crew can assure separation with the help of definitive visual acquisition of the aircraft causing
the RA. By not responding to the RA, the flight crew effectively takes responsibility for achieving
safe operation. In doing so, the following should be taken into consideration:
i) The traffic acquired visually may also be equipped with ACAS and it may manoeuvre in 
response to the RA that has been automatically coordinated with you own ACAS; 
ii) The traffic acquired visually may not be the same aircraft causing the RA; 
iii) Visual perception of the encounter may be misleading unless it is positively clear that the 
target acquired visually or confirmed by ATC is the one generating the RA and there are no 
other complicating circumstances. The pilot’s instinctive reaction should always be to respond 
to RA’s in the direction and to the degree displayed. 
c) Inform ATC of TA/RA and avoiding action taken and file an MOR as appropriate, to be 
forwarded to the and forward a copy to the Chief Executive Officer, SCAA, for safety 
investigation requirements. 
1.8.13.2  ATCOs responsibilities 
a)Upon receipt of TA/RA information from a pilot, the ATCO should attempt to establish the
identity of the intruder aircraft as far as practicable. The ATCO should not attempt to issue
clearances that would negate the correcting action being taken by the pilot as a result of a TA/RA
occurrence. The ATCO immediately double check all clearances issued to the aircraft concerned
in order to determine the possible cause of the confliction.
b)The ATCO shall log down the events of the occurrence, inform the immediate Supervisor and
shall file an MOR as appropriate. The occurrence shall be thoroughly investigated and safety
recommendations implemented to avoid recurrences.

1.8.14 STRATEGIC LATERAL OFFSET PROCEDURES (SLOP) 
1.8.14.1 INTRODUCTION 
Studies and safety analyses conducted by the ICAO Separation and Airspace Safety Panel (SASP) have shown that the 
application of a strategic lateral offset by aircraft from route centre line would result in an overall increase in safety of 
operations in remote and oceanic airspace. 
STRATEGIC LATERAL OFFSETS IN OCEANIC AIRSPACE 
Offsets may be applied beyond 200NM radius from the PRA DME and above FL290 in the oceanic airspace of the 
Seychelles FIR. 
Offset may only be applied by aircraft with automatic offset tracking capability. 
The following requirement may apply to the use of the offset;  
a)The decision to apply a strategic lateral offset is the responsibility of the flight crew;
b)The offset shall be established at a distance of one or two nautical miles to the right of the centre line relative
to the direction of flight. Offset are not to exceed two nautical miles right of the centre line;
c)The strategic lateral offset procedure has been designed to include offset to mitigate the effects of wake
turbulence of preceding aircraft. If wake turbulence needs to be avoided, one of the three available options
(centre line, 1 NM or 2 NM offset to the right) shall be used.
Pilots may contact other aircraft on the air to air frequency, 123.45 MHz or IATA in Flight Broadcasting
Frequency, 126.9 MHz, as necessary, to coordinate the best wake turbulence offset option.
d)In airspace where SLOP has been authorised, ATC clearance is not required for this procedure and pilots are not
required to inform ATC that an offset is being applied;
e)Position reports are based on the current ATC clearance and not the exact coordinates of the offset position.

e. Destination aerodrome and total estimate d
elapsed time,
f.
Route of flight,
g. Alternate aerodrome(s),
h. Persons on board and fuel endurance,i. Any other information relevant /desired 
for
operating such 
flight.
1.10.2 Time of submission  
Except 
for repetitive flight plans, a flight plan shall be 
submitted at least 30 minutes prior to departure, taking into account the requirements of ATS units including coordination requirements in the airspace along the route to be flown by the aircraft. 
1.10.3  Place of submission  
Flight plans shall be submi
tted to the aerodrome 
control tower , where available, at the departure aerodrome. In the absence of such an office at the departure aerodrome, a flight plan shall be submitted by telephone to the aerodrome control tower. 1.10.4 Contents and completion of a flight 
plan  
ICAO flight plan forms are availab
le at Seychelles 
International Airport (AIS and control tower).  The instructions for completing those forms shall be followed. 
When a flight plan is submitted by telephone or tele-
fax, the sequence of items in the flight plan form shall be strictly adhered to. 
1.10.5  Changes to a flight plan 
1.10.5.1
   Subject to the provisions in ICAO Annex 2, 
3.6.2.2 (Inadvertent Changes), all changes to a flight plan submitted for an IFR flight or a VFR flight 
operated as a controlled flight, shall be reported as 
soon as practicable to the appropriate air traffic services unit. 
1.10.5.2    For other VFR flights, significant changes to 
a flight plan shall be reported as soon as practicable to 
the appropriate air traffic services unit.  
1.10.5.3   In the event of a delay in departure of 30 
minutes or more for a flight for which a flight plan has 
been submitted, the flight plan shall be amended or a 
new flight plan shall be subm itted after the old plan 
has been cancelled. 
1.10.5.4    Whenever a flight, for which a flight plan 
has been submitted, is cancelled, the appropriate ATS 
unit shall be informed immediately. 
1.10.5.5 Changes to a current flight plan for a 
controlled flight during flight shall be reported or requested, subject to the provisions in ICAO Annex 2, 
3.6.2 (Adherence to flight plan).  
1.10.5.6 Significant changes to a flight plan for an 
uncontrolled VFR flight include changes in endurance or in the total number of persons on board and 
changes in time estimates of 30 minutes or more. 
1.10.5.7   If a delay in departure of a controlled flight 
is not properly reported, the relevant flight plan data may no longer be readily available to the appropriate 
ATS unit when a clearance is ultimately requested, 
which will consequently result in extra delay for the flight. 1.10.5.8   If a delay in departure (or cancellation) of an uncontrolled VFR flight is not properly reported, 
alerting or search and rescue action may be 
unnecessarily initiated when the flight fails to arrive at the destination aerodrome within 30 minutes after its 
current ETA.

 Seychelles Civil Aviation Authority AIP AMDT 1/06 ENR 1.13  UNLAWFUL INTERFERENCE 
1.13.1     Procedures (crew) 
The following procedures are intended for use by 
aircraft when unlawful interference occurs and the 
aircraft is unable to notify an ATS unit of this fact; 
1.13.1.2 Unless considerations onboard the aircraft 
dictate otherwise, the pilot-in-command should attempt to continue flying on the assigned track and at the 
assigned cruising level at least until notification to an 
ATS unit is possible, 
1.13.1.3 When an aircraft which is subjected to an act 
of unlawful interference must depart from its assigned 
track or its assigned cruising level without being able to 
make radiotelephony contact with local ATS, the pilot 
in command should whenever possible:- 
a) attempt to broadcast warnings on HF and the
VHF emergency frequency and other
appropriate frequencies unless considerations
aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise. Ot
her
e
quipment such as onboard transponders, da ta
l
inks etc, should also be used when it is
advantageous to do so and circumstance s
perm
it, an d
b)
proceed in accordance with applicable special
procedures for in - flight contingencies wher e
suc
h procedures have been established an d
pr
omulgated in Doc 7030 - Regional
Supplementary Procedures, or
c) if no applicable regional procedures have been
established, proceed at a level which differsfrom the cruising levels normally used for IFR
flight in the Seychelles FIR by 1000 ft (300m)
if above FL 290 or by  500ft (150m) if be
low
F
L 290.
1.13.2 Procedures (ATC)   
Once it is suspected or informed that an aircraft has 
been subjected to unlawful interference, local air traffic 
service units will endeavour to provide all necessary 
assistance to the aircraft concerned and shall immediately provide increased separation with other 
traffic. 
Air Traffic Control Officers will follow local standing 
instructions related to such circumstances.

NR 1.14 AIR TRAFFIC INCIDENTS 
1.14.1  Definition of air traffic incidents 
Air traffic incident is used to indicate a serious occurrence related to the provision of air traffic services such as; 
a)a ircraft proximity (AIRPROX),
b)Se rious difficulty resulting in a hazard to aircraft caused, for example, by;1)fa
ulty procedures,
2)non- compliance with procedures or,
3)failure of ground facilities
1.14.2  Definitions for aircraft proximity and AIRPROX 
Aircraft proximity: A situation in which in the opinion of the pilot or the air traffic services personnel, the 
d
istance between aircraft, as well as their relative position s and speed, has been such that the safety of the aircraft 
involved may have been compromised. Aircraft proximity is classified as follows:- 
a)Risk of  collision: The risk classification of aircraft proximity in which serious risk of collision has existed.
b)Safety not assured: The risk classification of aircraft proximity in which the safety of the aircraft may have been
compromised
c)No risk of collision: The risk classification of airc raft proximity in which no risk of collision has existed.
d)Risk not determined: The risk classification of aircraft proximity in which insufficient information was available to
determine the risk involved or inconclusive or conflicting evidence precluded such determination.
e)AIRPROX: The code word used in air traffic incident report to designated aircraft proximity.
1.14.3  Use of the Air Traffic Incident Report form (see model on pages ENR 1.14-3 to 1.14-7 ) 
           The Air Traffic Incident Report Form is intended for use; 
a) by a pilot for filing a report on air traffic incident after arrival or for confirming a report made initially by radio
during flight.
Note : The form, if available on board may also be of use in pr oviding a pattern for making the initial report in flight.  
b) By an ATS unit for recording an air traffic incident report received by radio or telephone.
Note : The form may be used as the form for the text of  a message to be transmitted over the AFS network.  
1.14.4. Reporting procedures (including in- flight procedures)  
The following are the procedures to be followed by a pilot who is or has been involved in an incident; 
a) during flight, use the appropriate air/ground frequency for reporting an incident of major significance, particular if
b) it involves other aircraft, so as to permit the facts to be ascertained immediately,
c) as promptly as possible after landing, submit a complete Air Traffic Incident Report
Form. An initial report made by radio should contain the following information:-

c) the incident; 1.a) and b), 2.a), b), c), d), n), 3.a), b), I,) 4.a, b),
d) miscellaneous, 1.e)
The confirmatory report on an incident of major significance initially reported by radio or the initial report on any  
other incident should be submitted to the Air Navigation  Services Division of SCAA for submission to the Chief 
Executive Officer. The pilot should complete the Air Traffic Incident Report Form, supplementing the details of the 
initial reports as necessary. 
1.14.5  P urpose of reporting and handling of the incident report form 
The purpose of reporting of aircraft proximity incidents and their investigation is to promote the safety of aircraft. The 
d
egree of risk involved in an aircraft proximity incident should be determined in the incident investigation and 
classified as “risk of Collis “safety not assured”, “no risk of collision” or “risk not determined. 
The purpose of the form is to provide investigatory authorities with as complete information on an air traffic incident 
a
s possible and to enable them to report back with the least possible delay to the pilot or operator concerned, the 
result of the investigation of the incident and, if appropriate, the remedial action taken.

ENR 4.2 DATA LINK SERVICES IN THE SEYCHELLES FIR 
4.2.1 INTRODUCTION 
4.2.1.1 Data link services are available to FANS1/A equipped aircraft operating in the Seychelles FIR on a 24-hour 
basis.  
4.2.1.2   The data link services will not affect current procedures for non-data link equipped aircraft operating in the 
same airspace. 
4.2.2  BBACKGROUND 
4.2.2.1   Controller Pilot Da
ta Link Communications (CPDLC) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Contract (ADS-C) 
data link applications will be used to provide services to FANS1/A equipped aircraft, in particular over the 
oceanic region beyond existing VHF voice communications. 
4.2.2.2 Messages will be transferred by satellite data links. 
4.2.2.3 CPDLC supports the following services: 
a) Emergency aler ting;
b)
Pilot to Controller downlink of posit ion reports and clearance requests;
c)
Controller to Pilot uplink of A TC clearances and instructions; and
d)
Free text as a supplement to pre-formatted message elements .
4.2.2.4 
The provision of Pre-Departure Clearance (PDC) via CPDLC will not be available. 
4.2.2.5 ADS-C supports the following services: 
a) Emergency aler ting; and
b)
Automatic reporting by the aircraft Flight Management System (FMS) of aircraft position an d intent
information. 
The FMS reports the required information in accordance with parameters selected by the
ground sy stem.
4.2.3  LOGON PROCEDURES 
4.2.3.1 The AFN LOGON address  for Seychelles FIR is FSSS. 
4.2.3.2 To avoid automatic rejection of the LOGON, the flight identification number used by the pilot in the LOGON 
process must be identical to the flight identification number filed in the flight plan. 
4.2.3.3 A LOGON must be received from the aircraft before any data link connections can be initiated by the ground 
system. This is achieved via the ATS Facility Notification (AFN) LOGON process to be initiated by the pilot in 
accordance with company procedures. 
4.2.3.4 Aircraft requesting data link services inbound to Seychelles FIR are required to manually LOGON onto FSSS at 
least 15 minutes prior to the estimated time for entering the Seychelles FIR. Data link equipped aircraft departing from aerodromes within the Seychelles FIR, and requesting data link shall LOGON to FSSS as soon as possible after departure. Pilots who are unable to establish data link connection are to inform ATC on VHF or HF radio. 
4.2.4 CPDLC APPLICATION 
4.2.4.1 Aircraft that have established data link connections will maintain CPDLC as the primary communication 
means. When using CPDLC, the primary and secondary HF voice frequencies will be used as back-up 
communication medium and a SELCAL check will be conducted.

03 APR 14 SEYCHELLES 

AIP AMDT 1/14 Seychelles Civil Aviation Authority 
4.2.4.2 To ensure the correct synchronization of messages, controller/pilot dialogues opened by CPDLC must be 
closed by CPDLC. Controller/pilot dialogues opened by voice must be closed by voice. 
4.2.4.3 Due to inherent integrity checks and a coded reference to any preceding related message contained within 
CPDLC messages, a clearance issued by CPDLC requires only the appropriate CPDLC response, not a read back 
as would be required if the clearance had been issued by voice. 
4.2.4.4 The downlink response “WILCO” indicates that the pilot accepts the full terms of the whole uplink message. 
4.2.4.5  A downlink message response “AFFIRM” is not an  acceptable acknowledgement or reply to a CLEARANCE 
issued by CPDLC. 
4.2.4.6 To avoid ambiguity in message handling and response, a CPDLC downlink message should not contain more 
than one clearance request. 
4.2.4.7 If multiple clearance requests are contained in a single downlink message and the controller cannot approve 
all requests, the uplink message “UNABLE” will be sent as a response to the entire message. A separate 
message containing a response to those requests that can be complied with will be sent by the controller. 
4.2.4.8 If any ambiguity exists as to the intent of a particular message, clarification must be sought by voice. 
4.2.4.9 Standard pre-formatted message elements must be us ed whenever possible. Free text messages should be only 
when an appropriate pre-formatted message element does not exist or to supplement the pre-formatted 
message element. The use of free text should be kept to a minimum. 
4.2.4.10 When CPDLC connection is established, aircraft will be instructed to transfer from voice to CPDLC. Pilots 
should then downlink a CPDLC position report at the FIR Boundary entry point then ADS reporting only. 
This is to ensure that CPDLC connection is active with Seychelles Control. 
4.2.4.11 When CPDLC connection is established, aircraft will be instructed to transfer from voice to CPDLC. The 
phraseology used is: 
TRANSFER TO SEYCHELLES CONTROL ON DATA LINK: 
MONITOR [HF frequency primary/secondary] 
4.2.4.12 CPDLC connections will be terminated at the FIR boundary position or when entering VHF coverage. The 
CONTACT [unit name][frequency] message and the END SERVICE message will be sent as separate messages. 
The END SERVICE message will be sent as soon as possi ble after receipt of the WILCO response message to 
the CONTACT message. 
4.2.5 ADS-C APPLICATION 
4.2.5.1 ADS Periodic and Event contracts will be established automatically after a successful LOGON. 
4.2.5.2 The Periodic reporting interval is 27 minutes and the Event reporting is compulsory reporting points. 
4.2.5.3 ADS contracts will be manually terminated at the Seychelles FIR boundary by the controller.  
4.2.6 DATA LINK FAILURE 
4.2.6.1 
Pilots recognizing a failure of a CPDLC connection must immediately establish communications on the 
appropriate voice frequency. Voice must continue to be used as the primary medium for communication until 
a CPDLC connection has been re-established and the controller has authorized the return to data link 
4.2.6.2 In the event of an unexpected CPDLC shutdown, the controller will immediately advise all data link 
connected aircraft of the failure by voice. Instructions will continue to be issued by voice until the return of 
data link system. The return of the system to an operational state will require a new AFN LOGON from the 
affected aircraft.

4.2.6.3 In case of ADS only failure, Seychelles Control shall inform pilots of the failure and CPDLC position reports 
will be used. 
4.2.7 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
4.2.7.1 Pilots should notify ATC of emergency situations by the most appropriate means (voice or  CPDLC) 
4.2.7.2 If a CPDLC MAYDAY/ PAN message is received, the controller will immediately  acknowledge receipt of the 
emergency by using the Free Text message " "ROGER  MAYDAY/PAN" 
4.2.7.3 Normal emergency procedures shall be followed. Controller may also attempt to make voice contact with the 
pilot. 
4.2.8 FLIGHT PLAN  NOTIFICATION 
4.2.8.1 Aircraft planning to utilize data link communication must annotate their ICAO flight plan as follows: 
a) CPDLC capability must be notified by inserting the alphanumeric designator J5 or J6 in Item 10 Field 10a;
b) ADS-C capability must be notified by inserting the alphanumeric designator D1 in Item 10 Field 10b;c) Aircraft registration must be inserted in Item 18 as the ground system uses the informati
on during the
AFN LOGON;

 Seychelles Civil Aviation Authority AIP AMDT 1/06 AD 1.4 GROUPING OF AERODROMES AND HELICOPTER LANDING AREAS 
The cr
iteria applied by Seychelles in grouping 
aerodromes and helicopter landing areas for the provision 
of information in this AIP is as follows:- 
1.
Primary or major international aerodromes
and helicopter landing area s
The ae
rodromes and helicopter landing areas of entry or 
departure for international air traffic, where:- 
a) all formalities concerning import control,immigration, health, animal and plant quarantineand similar procedures are carried out,
b) air traffic services are available on a regular andcontinuous basis (H24)
.
2.
Secondary or other international aerodromes
and helicopter landing area s
Ther
e are currently no designated secondary or other 
international  aerodromes and helicopter landing areas 
listed for this purpose in Seychelles. 
Apart from Seychelles International Airport, all other 
aerodromes and helicopter landing areas are used 
primarily for domestic air traffic. 
However, in special circum stances or in cases of 
emergency, Praslin aerodrome may be designated as the 
secondary aerodrome depending on the operating 
performance of the aircraft and the nature of emergency at 
the time.

Warning 
Rapid change
s of wind spee d and direction and moderate to severe turbulence often occur on both runway 
approaches but particularly on the approach to runway 13 at Seychelles International Airport. Reports of wind 
shear in excess of 20 knots have been received from aircra ft approaching to RWY 13 when surface wind is in the 
sector 140º – 240º at speeds of 15 knots or more during the south east monsoons.  Strong updrafts and downdrafts 
often occur during these conditions during the latter stages of the approach and along the runway .

Notes:   
1. SALS /RAIL
The approa
ch lighting to RWY 13 is a variable five stage Hi gh Intensity collocated SALS and RAIL system containing the 
following elements:- 
2 NM ARRAY  - A line of lights 2nm from touchdown consisti ng of five concrete pontoons 200ft apart each 
pontoon carrying four lights, three of which are steady and one flashing in sequence be ckoning aircraft towards the 
runway. These flashing lights are on a diff erent circuit and can be switched on and off separately from the steady lights. 
The lights are angled towards the NE direction in order to give early guidance to aircraft. 
1 NM ARRAY  - Situated 1 nm from touchdown, a line of five concrete pontoons spaced 200ft apart each 
carrying four lights, three of which are steady and one flas hing in sequence beckoning aircraft towards the runway. A 
roll guidance bar consisting of four conc rete pontoons either  side of the first lead in  pontoons forms an inverted Tee 
(T) to approaching aircraft. These pontoon s carry two steady lights each lights and are  spaced to give the bar a width 
of 175  feet. 
2. RTIL: Flashin
g White at 60 flashes every minute.
3. PAPI: RWY 13 is offset to NE and must not be used when  
more than 2.6NM from the RW Y due to   intervening high

1. Introduction
1.1 The following RNP-1 SIDs and STARs are designed in accordance with criteria as stipulated in the ICAO 
PANS-OPS (Doc 8168) Volume 2. 
1.2 For RNP-1 STARs and SIDs operations, the aircraft shall be equipped and the navigation systems shall meet the 
ICAO RNP-1 standard of accuracy, or equivalent, such as JAA TGL 10 or FAA AC 90-96A Appendix 2- 
Precision Area Navigation (P-RNAV). 
1.3 Operators shall ensure that they hold the necessary operational approvals as part of the Operations 
Specification of the AOC in order to conduct RNP-1 SIDs and STARs. 
1.4 SID and STAR FMS coding tables are provided at 3 below. Significant point coordinates are published in ENR

2. FSIA Standard Instrument Departure (SID) 
2.1 FSIA Standard Instrument Departure (SID) Procedures 
2.1.1 Departing aircraft shall contact Seychelles APP as soon as possible after passing 1000 FT, unless otherwise 
instructed by Seychelles TWR. 
Note: see FSIA AD 2.22.3 for action in the event of radio failure. 
2.1.2 Departing IFR traffic leaving Seychelles CTA while on a SID is required to: 
a.Climb at a minimum gradient of 5% to 1,500 FT (300 FT per NM) for RWY 13;
b.Climb at a minimum gradient of 8% to 1,000 FT (486 FT per NM) for RWY 31;
c.Observe speed restrictions as per FMS coding tables;
d.Level restrictions that apply at waypoints is displayed on the chart;
e.Advise ATC at start-up if unable to comply
2.2 FSIA Standard Instrument Departure (SID) Level Restrictions 
2.2.1 Initial climb is restricted to FL 060. Further climb clearance as instructed by Seychelles APP. 
2.2.2 When a departing aircraft on a SID is cleared to climb to a level higher than the initially cleared level or the 
level(s) specified in a SID, the aircraft shall climb directly to the cleared level, unless the SID vertical restrictions 
are reiterated as part of the clearance. 
2.2.3 For all stages of flight, clearances to climb, cancel any previous restrictions or levels, unless they are reiterated 
as part of the clearance. 
2.2.4 Aircraft when first approaching a cleared level should ensure that the vertical closure speed is not excessive 
and must avoid overshooting the cleared level, manually overriding if necessary. 
2.2.5 ATC may cancel a SID and provide direct routing.

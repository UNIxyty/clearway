3-1. The Pushback procedure is implemented only in Apron NR1. 
 
3-2. Kish Tower is responsible for issuing pushback approval, as well as startup approval and taxi clearance. 
Note1: Start-up approval on stand does not imply an approval to pushback.  
Note2: Aircraft shall not commence start-up, pushback, or any other maneuvers on the apron, unless they ha ve 
obtained approval from Kish Tower. 
 
3-3. Pushback maneuver us es for those aircrafts which park ed in stands 100 -102L,102,102R-104L,104,104R-

the TWR controller may issue deviating instructions with the assistance of follow-me car. 
 
4.1.2. Aircraft holding at all Runway Holding Positions are to ensure that the aircraft nose is exactly at the Runway 
Holding Position to ensure adequate clearance with other aircraft crossing behind/ahead. 
 
Note: when an aircraft with more than 57m length (such as B747 and/or A340) holds short of a runway on TWYs 
B1, B2, B3, B4, B7, B8 ; the other runway will not be useable for takeoff and landing. 
 
4.1.3. Unless otherwise specified by the controller, taxiing speed is MAX 30 KT on TWYs and MAX 10 KT in the 
parking area  
4.1.4. Pilots should use minimum taxi power when operating on the apron to reduce the effect of jet blast on 
the surrounding area. 
 
4-2 Departure: 
4.2.1. Aircraft are required to request taxi during the validity time (10 minutes after start up approval).  
 
4.2.2. All departure aircraft fro m apron N R1 should taxi out via D1 and then TWY C4 and continue to the clearance 
limit by ATC. 
 
4.2.3. All depa rture aircraft entering TWY A via TWY  C4, should give way to the aircraft taxiing on TWY A unless 
otherwise instructed by the controller. This does not relieve the controller of his responsibility. 
 
 
4-3 Arrival: 
4.3.1-Aircraft shall never cross RWYs unless crossing permission is given by tower controller. 
 
4.3.2-All arriving aircraft intended to park in  apron N R1 should enter to the apron via TWY C5 except those super

4.3.3- Marshaller guidance is mandatory for  pilots of arriving aircraft upon entering the parking area to their allocated 
stands. 
 
5-Start-up Procedure: 
Note. See also ENR 1.9 and ENR 1.10

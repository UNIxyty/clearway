1. Heavy aircraft are authorized to make 180 DEG turns only at the end of RWY 31/13.  
2. Intensive bird accumulation exists in the vicinity of AD during autumn and winter.  
3. Aircraft taxiing on the apron shall use minimum power due to the proximity of terminals and installation. To avoid 
FOD in the movement area, Heavy aircraft at all times shall taxi with low RPM to reduce the jet blast effect.  
4. Engine test operation shall be held within the intersection of TWY D and F.  
Engine tests of 5 minutes or less may be held in a parking position with idle engine operation and prior to engine testing 
provided there is no traffic. 
Coordination with ground control on frequency 121.725 MHZ is required. All safety measures shall be taken in the 
testing area by the operator performing engine test. 
5. Isolated aircraft parking position located at intersection of TWY D and F as a temporary area.  
6. Hot spot : 
Hotspot 1: 
TWY A is used for helicopter movement from helipad. aircraft taxiing via TWY E for RWY13. Pilots are to maintain 
good lookout at intersection TWY E and A and all aircraft on TWY A must hold short of RWY13.

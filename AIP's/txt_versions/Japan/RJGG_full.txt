Visual Docking Guidance System (VDGS)
I.SAFEDOCK
1.General
(1)  Aircraft parking stands NR2 - 12, 14 - 24 are equipped with a visual docking guidance system.
The pilots of an arriving aircra ft assigned to park at one of these parking stands can use this system to be guided and stop th e
aircraft at the correct parking position.
(2) This system is operational only in the automatic mode and in an  event of a system failure, the aircraft shall be manually gu ided
by a marshaller to the stopping position.
(3) The visual docking guidance system consists of a display screen for pilots and a laser scanner.
The system detects and analyses the aircraft  type of an approaching aircraft, tracks it through the laser scanner, and displays
these results on the display screen.
(4) The display screen indicates the following information:
a) type of the approaching aircraft
b) deviation from the lead-in center line
c) distance to the stopping position.
The above information is provided equally to the pilots on both left seat and right seat.
 
 
2. Aircraft Type Indication
(1) A message about the aircraft type from SAFIS (Stand Allocation
& Flight Information System) shall be confirmed and put into the
system by ground operator. The system then carries out internal
calibration and starts laser scanning simultaneously. The system
shows the aircraft type on the display screen and then will begin
to indicate yellow lead-in arrows scrolling upwards prompting the
aircraft to proceed. (Fig.1, Fig.2)
(2) When the laser scanner detects the approaching aircraft, the
display screen will indicate the aircraft type, a "T" bar, and a
lead-in upward arrow in yellow. (Fig.3)
(3) At least until the approaching aircraft arrives at a point 15 meters
before the stopping position, the sys tem will identify the aircraft
type and will compare with the prev iously input aircraft type. If
these data match, the system wi ll continue its operation. If they
do not match, the display screen will continue displaying
"STOP","ID FAIL". (Fig.4)
NOTE: At this moment, the pilots must stop the aircraft
immediately.
When the operator re-input the correct aircraft type into the
system and the system finds it correct, it resumes normal
operations indicating the correct aircraft type on its display
screen.

3. Spot-in and Lateral Center line Guidance
(1) When entering an aircraft parking stand using the system, the
pilots should maneuver the aircraft at a low speed to the
stopping position. In an event when "SLOW" is indicated on the
display screen, the pilots should further decelerate the taxiing
speed to avoid overshooting. (Fig.5)
The speed displayed as “SLOW” is 7kt when over 20m from the
stop position, 5kt between 10m and 20m, and 4kt between 0m
and 10m.
(2) Deviation of an upward yellow arrow from the center line of "T" indicates the deviation of the approaching aircraft
relative to the center line of the parking stand either  to right or left. Further, an additional flashing red arrow on
the either side indicates the required direction for the aircraft to turn (Fig.6, Fig.7), and numerical value of
remaining distance. (Fig.8, Fig.9)
4. Stop Guidance
(1) When the approaching aircraft is within 20 meters from the sto pping position, the shaft of the illuminated "T" will start to  reduce
in its length from the bottom to indicate the approaching rate of  the aircraft, indicating the remaining distance to the stoppi ng
position successively. (Fig.10, Fig.11)
As the aircraft approaches the stopping position, the shaft of the illuminated "T" retract one row for every 0.3 meters.
When the approaching aircraft is within 30 meters from the stopping position, display of digital countdown will start.
As the aircraft approaches the stopping position, digital countdown is  for every 1.0 meters (from 30 to 5 meters to the stoppin g
position) or for every 0.5 meters (from 5 to 2 meters to the st opping position) or for every 0.1 meters (from 2 meters to the
stopping position). (Fig.12, Fig.13)

(2) When the aircraft reaches t he stopping position, a message
"STOP" with a red border will be displayed on the screen.
(Fig.14)
(3) When the aircraft is stopped at the correct stopping position, a
message "OK" will be displayed on the screen in several
seconds. (Fig.15)
(4) When the operator applies chocks, and switches on "CHOCK
ON" switch, a message "CHOCK ON" will be displayed on the
screen. (Fig.16)
(5) If the aircraft stops at a position beyond the correct stopping
position, a message "TOO FAR" will be displayed on the screen.
(Fig.17)

5. Cautions and Safety
(1) When the system displays an incorrect aircraft type, or when
such a message as "STOP", "ID", "FAIL", or "WAIT" appears on
the display screen, the pilots should stop the aircraft
immediately. (Fig.4, Fig.14, Fig.18)
(2) Bad weather condition, during heavy fog, rain or snow the
visibility for the docking sy stem can be reduced. When the
system is activated and in capture mode, the display will
deactivate the floating arrows and show "SLOW". (Fig.19)
The message will be superseded by the "T" bar as soon as the
system detects the approaching aircraft.
The pilot must not proceed beyond the passenger boarding
bridge, unless the "SLOW" message has been superseded by
the "T" bar.

6. Remarks
(1) In CHUBU CENTRAIR, stopping positions are different depending on the aircraft size, aircraft type or each stand. Stopping
positions of small aircraft are further than large aircraft from the end of center line. The length is Maximum 27 meters away from
the end of center line.
And the length is Maximum 63 meters away from the VDGS. (Fig.20) 
So, small aircraft must reduce the speed sufficiently beforehand. Pilot should keep this in mind, before going into the stand.
As a reference, painted markings of the model name are provided at the stopping positions of some small aircrafts.
 *Small aircraft : B737, A320, MD90, ERJ etc.
Maximum 63m Maximum 27m
䯲The stopping
position for the
same model of
aircraft might be
different
depending on the
stand.

RODN AD 2.22 FLIGHT PROCEDURES
1.Procedure is strictly enforced, no ARR/DEP between 1300- 2100 without prior approval.  Except Air Mobility Command
priority missions.
2. Extremely dense population in the areas to the north, nor thwest and east of KADENA AB (RODN) requires all pilots
minimize aircraft noise to the maximum extent possible, particularly during hours of darkness, on weekends, and holidays.
Deviations from noise abatement procedures require prior approval.
3. The following specific procedures will be strictly enforced: 
1) Straight-in, full stops 1300-2100 daily, 1300SAT through 2100SUN (0600 Local on MON), and during holidays as
indicated by local advisory and NOTAMs, no exceptions without prior approval.
2) Use of afterburner over Okinawa and on takeoff is prohibited except for safety of flight or when operationally required.
Pilots are responsible for ensuring that they have obtained prior permission.
3) Transient aircraft requesting Visual Flight Rule patterns can expect Runway 05R /23L, and will minimize requests for
multiple Visual Flight Rule patterns on weekdays.
4) Multiple Radar and VFR patterns are approved 2100 -1300 (2100SUN-1300FRI) and prohibited weekends/holidays.
Saturday patterns between 2100FRI-1300SAT require prior approval.
5) Closed pattern traffic will delay pulling up to turn for downwind leg until passing the end of the runway unless
otherwise directed by ATC.
6) Closed traffic patterns will be flown in a clean confi guration until established on the downwind leg, unless an
emergency or service procedure requires leaving the aircraft in the landing configuration.
7) Engine Runs above idle, other than for takeof f, are only authorized 2100-1300 (2100SUN-1300FRI) and SUN/
holidays 0300-0900.
8) During times of local Quiet Periods, all aircraft straight -in, full stop.  No engine runs above idle unless hush house or
test cell facility used.  No departures without prior approval.  Local quiet periods are issued via NOTAM.
9) No VTOL hover checks Saturday, Sunday, and holidays.  VTOL landing Saturday, Sunday and holidays only if cross
winds are 10 kts or greater.  The use of vertical thrust ers by aircraft is unauthorized on Runway 05R/23L and 05L/
23R.
10) Minimize reverse thrust to max extent.
11)  Avoid over flight of Naha city below 4000ft.
12) Avoid over flight of Ie-Shima Island below 4000ft.
13) Avoid over flight of Hospital at 2618.8N12746.3E (KAD R-182 2.5DME)
14) Local holiday observances and school testing restrictions published by NOTAM.
1.Traffic Pattern Altitudes:
Jet Tactical and/or Overhead 
- 1,800 MSL.
Aircraft inbound to initial shall maintain 2,500 feet unless a lower altitude is approved by ATC.  Aircraft shall descend to
1,800 feet MSL (initial altitude) at 5 DME or once established on initial and inside the Kadena Delta Airspace.
Conventional Rectangular - 1,300 feet MSL.
Aircraft shall enter the pattern at 1,300 feet MSL, or as dire cted by Tower. Unless directed by Tower, aircraft shall fly a
left hand pattern to Runway 05L and 23L and right pattern to Runway 05R and 23R.  When flying right pattern to
Runway 05L/R, extend downwind until over the water prior to turning base, avoid angling final, and be aligned with the
runway centerline prior to reaching the land area.
Helicopter and Aero Club - 800 feet MSL.
Helicopters will conform to the established rectangular pattern, except pattern altitude will be 800 feet MSL.
Approaches to/departures from helipads will be in the direction of the designated runw ay in use, unless otherwise
authorized by Tower. 
The Overhead pattern (1,800ft) is only open from sunrise to civil twilight.  This restriction does not apply to the Conventional
Rectangular pattern (1,300ft) or the Helicopter and Aero Club pattern (800ft). 
During VMC, all aircraft must remain below 1,300ft until departure end of RWY to ensure separation of overhead traffic
pattern, unless otherwise cleared by ATC.  All aircraft contact GND prior to engine start.

2. Lost communication procedures for arrival aircraft under radar navigational guidance
If radio communications with Naha Approach/Kadena Arrival are lost for 1 minute, squawk Mode A/3 Code 7600 and;
(1)
a) Contact Kadena Tower.
b) If unable, proceed in accordance with Visual Flight Rules, proceed to IAF as filed in flight plan at FL190. Normally descend
or climb to maintain FL190, no closer than 50 DME from KAD.  On a filed ETA or EFC (if received), descend to FL150 and
execute the penetration and approach to the active runway or the last known runway in use. If VMC is encountered
proceed under VFR rules.
(2)Regardless of weather conditions or ty pe of flight plan filed, the approach or landing should be planned for Runway 05L or
23R.  On final approach, check PAPI lights to verify direction of traffic.
(3) Procedures other than above will be issued when situation required. 
3. ATC Radar Beacon Program.
Aircraft flying under control of Naha approach control in the approac h control area will be instructed to reply with discrete c ode
on Mode A/3 and Mode C.  If an aircraft with non-discrete code capabi lity be instructed to reply with the discrete code, it sha ll
report a controller accordingly.

RODN AD 2.23 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
5. WX MINIMA CONCERNING ASR APCH PROCEDURE
NOTE:REPRINTING DOD FLIP
RWY 05L/23R closed every 4th FRI2230-SAT0230
RWY 05R/23L closed every 4th SAT0330-0730 
Extensive jet and low level act WI 50NM of Kadena 2300-1000 (2300SUN-1000FRI)
BIRD CONCENTRATIONS/AREAS.
Bird activity at Kadena AB (RODN) increases during the months  of September through December. Much of this increase is
due to plovers wintering in the area. Egrets frequent airfield grassy areas in APR, MAY , SEP, and OCT, particularly during
mowing operation. Use caution for large flocks of small shorebirds, especially when heavy rains produce standing water. Bird
activity in the local ranges and low-level areas does not present a significant strike hazard to Kadena’s aircraft.
a) Phase Designations: Phase I and Phase II designations are based on historical bird activity. Should conditions warrant,
the Operations Group Commander can el evate Phase I to Phase II based on su stained, out of season increased bird
activity.
1) Phase I represents residential bird activity, and will no rmally be from January 1st through March 31st, and from June
1st through August 31st.
2) Phase II represents heavy/migratory bird activity, and will normally be designated from April 1st through May 31st, and
September 1st through December 31st.
b) Bird Condition Codes:
1) Bird Watch Condition SEVERE: Bird activity on or immediately above the active runway or other specific location
representing high potential for strikes.  Supervisors  and aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission need before
conducting operations in areas under Bird Watch Condition (BWC) SEVERE.
2) Bird Watch Condition MODERATE: Bird activity near the active runway or other specific location representing
increased potential for strikes.  BWC MODERATE require s increased vigilance by a ll agencies and supervisors and
caution by aircrews.
3) Bird Watch Condition LOW: Bird activity on and around the airfield representing low potential for strikes.

VISUAL DOCKING GUIDANCE SYSTEM
1. General
(1) Aircraft parking stands NR0 - NR19, NR63 - NR71, are equipped with a visual docking guidance system.
The pilots of an arriving aircraft assigned to park at one of  these parking stands can use this system to be guided and stop th e
aircraft at the correct parking position.
(2) This system is operational only in the automatic mode and in an event of a system failure, the aircraft shall be manually guided by
a marshaller to the stopping position.
(3) The visual docking guidance system consists of a display screen for pilots and a laser scanner. The system detects and analyses
the aircraft type of an approaching aircraft, tracks it through the laser scanner, and displays these results on the display screen.
(4) The display screen indicates the following information:
a) type of the approaching aircraft
b) deviation from the lead-in center line
c) distance to the stopping position
The above information is provided equally to the pilots on both left seat and right seat.
2. Aircraft Type lndication
(1) An operator on ground shall input the aircraft type into the system before the aircraft approaches the parking stand.
Upon accepting the input, the system carries out internal calibr ation, starts the laser scanner  simultaneously, and indicates t he
aircraft type according to the input. The sy stem then will begin to indicate yellow lead-in arrows scrolling upwards prompting the
aircraft to proceed. (Fig.1, Fig.2)
(2) When the laser scanner detects the approaching aircraft, the display screen will indicate the aircraft type, a "T" bar, and a lead-in
upward arrow in yellow.
(3) At least until the approaching aircraft arrives at a point 15 meters before the stopping position, the system will identify the aircraft
type and will compare with the previously input aircraft type. If these data match, the system will continue its operation. If they do
not match, the display screen will indicate "STOP" with a red border, and "ID FAIL" simultaneously. (Fig.3)
NOTE: At this moment, the pilots must stop the aircraft immediately.
When the operator re-input the correct aircraft type into the s ystem and the system finds it correct, it resumes normal operati ons
indicating the correct aircraft type on its display screen.

3. Taxiing and Lateral Center line Guidance
(1) While taxiing the aircraft using the system, the pilots s hould maneuver the aircraft at a low speed to the stopping positio n. In an
event when "SLOW" is indicated on the di splay screen, the pilots should further  decelerate the taxiing speed to avoid
overshooting. (Fig.4)
(2) Deviation of an upward yellow arrow from the center line of  "T" indicates the deviation of the approaching aircraft relativ e to the
center line of the parking stand either to right or left. Fu rther, an additional flashing red ar row on the either side indicate s the
required direction for the aircraft to turn(Fig.5, Fig.6) and indicate numerical value of remaining distance. (Fig.7, Fig.8)

4. Stop Guidance
(1) When the approaching aircraft is within 20 meters from the stopping position, the shaft of the illuminated "T" will start to reduce in
its length from the bottom to indicate the approaching rate of the aircraft, indicating the remaining distance to the stopping position
successively. (Fig.9, Fig.10, Fig.11, Fig12) As the aircraft approaches the stopping position, the shaft of the illuminated "T" retract
one row for every 0.3m.
At aircraft parking stands when the approaching aircraft is within 30 meters from the stopping position, display of digital countdown
will start.
As the aircraft approaches the stopping position, a digital countdown shows the distance to stop position numerically, for every 1.0
meters (from 30 to 5 meters to the stop position), for every 0.5 meters (from 5 to 2 meters to the stop position) or for every 0.1
meters (from 2 to 0 meters to the stop position).
(2) When the aircraft reaches the stopping position, a message "STOP" will be displayed on the screen with a red border. (Fig.13)
(3) When the aircraft is stopped at the correct stopping position, a message "OK" will be displayed on the screen in several seconds.
(Fig.14)
(4) When the operator applies chocks, and switches on "CHOCK ON" switch, the display screen will display "CHOCK ON." (Fig.15)

(5) If the aircraft stops at a position beyond the correct stopp ing position, a message "TOO FAR" will be displayed on the scre en.
(Fig.16)
5. Cautions and Safety
(1) When the system displays an incorrect aircraft type, or w hen such a message as "STOP", "ID FAIL", or "WAIT" appears on the
display screen, the pilots should stop the aircraft immediately. (Fig.3, Fig.13, Fig.17)
(2) During heavy fog, rain or snow the visibility for the docking system can be reduced. When the system is activated and in capture
mode, the display will deactivate the floating arrows and show "SLOW" (Fig.18). The message will be superseded by the closing
rate bar as soon as the system detects the approaching airc raft. The pilot must not proceed beyond the bridge, unless the
"SLOW" text has been superseded by the closing rate bar.

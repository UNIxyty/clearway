35DME one-minute racetrack pattern until receiving an IFR clearance from VC Bird Approach Control. Please note it 
might take some time due to coordination procedures or airspace congestion, before the pilot can receive an IFR 
clearance.
c. Report your intentions on the appropriate discrete TAPB frequency 122.950 MHz before moving on to the active
runway.

14. PIARCO FIR (TTZP)
INTERIM ROUTINGS TO BE UTILIZED WITHIN THE PIARCO FIR DUE TO THE  REMOVAL OF THE   
UA550, UA551 AND UA561  ROUTES     
Effective: 230927 to 240930
The reorganization of the Piarco Flight Information Region is being implemented in a phased 
approach. 
Currently, based on collaboration with all stakeholders, the upper airspace has been redesigned 
taking into account the Performance Based Navigation (PBN) concept. In addition, through the 
CANSO/IATA/ICAO Free Route Airspace (CIIFRA) initiative, a number of pre-approved optimized 
routes have been implemented.
The next phase of the airspace optimization project involves the connection of the new/revised 
upper airspace routes to the lower airspace arrival and departure routes into the aerodromes 
within the Piarco FIR. The implementation of this phase is expected to take place over 2023/2024. 
Aircraft Operators and Flight Dispatchers are urged to please take note of the following:
- Routes implemented in the Piarco FIR which have been incorporated into the Eastern Caribbean 
AIP (ENR 3.2):
• UP533
• UN669
• UP410
• UM662
SUP2-1
20 JUL 21
- Conventional routes which have been removed from the Piarco FIR:
• UA550
• UA551
• UA561
With regards to flights that previously utilized the UA550, UA551 and UA561 between the Piarco 
and Maiquetia FIRs, the following are suggested routings to be filed in the interim until the full 
implementation of the Piarco FIR Airspace Optimization is completed:
(a) Aircraft landing/departing TAPA that previously utilized the UA550, may file: ITEGO DCT 
DUNTA DCT ANU or the reciprocal.
(b) Aircraft landing/departing TFFR that previously utilized the UA550, may file: ITEGO DCT PPR or 
the reciprocal.

=== Page 47 ===
(c) Aircraft landing/departing TFFF that previously utilized the UA551, may file: ONGAL DCT FOF 
or the reciprocal.
(d) Aircraft landing/departing TLPL that previously utilized the UA551, may file: ONGAL DCT BNE 
or the reciprocal.
(e) Aircraft landing/departing TGPY that previously utilized the UA561, may file: ILVAS DCT GND 
or the reciprocal.
(f) Aircraft landing/departing TBPB that previously utilized the UA561, may file: ILVAS DCT BGI or 
the reciprocal.
(g) Aircraft landing/departing TVSA that previously utilized the UA561, may file: ILVAS DCT SV or 
the reciprocal.
NOTE: Notwithstanding the above suggested routings, any flight entering the Piarco FIR from the 
Maiquetia FIR 
may file from any waypoint along the Piarco/Maiquetia boundary to a destination 
aerodrome WITHIN the Piarco FIR.
Questions or alternative requests regarding these interim procedures can be directed to:

EIKN AD 2.20 LOCAL TRAFFIC REGULATIONS
1. Taxiing Restrictions
180 degree turns for Medium or Heavy category aircraft on RWY 08/26 only permitted at runway turn pads unless 
otherwise instructed by ATC.
Aircraft using the turn pads should follow the marked guidance lines and use the minimum speed necessary to 
complete the turning manoeuvre.
2. Availability of Intersection Take-Off’s
2.1 Take off’s using less than the full length of the runway are  available from TWY/RWY intersections outlined in EIKN 
AD 2.13 DECLARED DISTANCES. The datum from which the reduced declared distances on RWY 08/26 are 
measured is the intersection of the extended downwind edge of the specific taxiway with the runway edge, projected 
perpendicular to the runway centreline.
2.2 The take-off run available (TORA) is displayed on an illumin ated sign adjacent to the taxiway (left side).
2.3 Intersection take-off’s are subject at all times to pilots d iscretion and aircraft operational requirements. Pilots should 
advise as early as possible of their ability to accept intersection take-off’s.
2.4 Approval for intersection take-off is subject to air traffic  situation.
3. Runway Operations and Lighting Configurations 
3.1 The end of the TORA and LDA for Runway 26 is marked by a row  of inset RED lights. These lights will be illuminated 
for aircraft landing or taking off on Runway 26.
3.2 The end of the TORA and LDA for Runway 08 is marked by a row  of inset RED lights. These lights will be illuminated 
for aircraft landing or taking off on Runway 08.
3.3 The start of the Runway pavement available for aircraft depa rting Runway 26 is marked by a row of elevated RED 
Runway end lights. These lights mark the physical end of the runway pavement and the limits of the Runway end 
turning areas. These lights will be illuminated for aircraft taking off on Runway 26. These lights will be illuminated 
following a landing on Runway 08 when the aircraft is on its landing roll once ATC extinguish the set of RED inset 
lights marking the LDA for Runway 08.

Operations Unrestricted
EIKN AD 2.22 FLIGHT PROCEDURES
1. Holding areas Protected airspace is provided for Holding Area s in accordance with the criteria contained in PANS -
OPS ICAO Doc 8168, Volume II to facilitate navigation using VOR, NDB and DME navigation aids.
2. SID and STAR
2.1. RNAV Equipped Aircraft SID and  STAR for RWY26 and RWY08 have been developed in accordance with ICAO 
Doc 8168 (PANS OPS) and comply with EUROCONTROL guidelines for the design of Terminal Procedures for Area 
Navigation. The supporting navigation infrastructure includes the choice of DME/DME, GNSS, VOR/DME (for 
reversionary navigation purposes) and INS/IRS as permitted by the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and/or approved 
by the appropriate regulatory authority.
SID and STAR for RWY08 and RWY26 have been developed in accordance with ICAO Doc 8168 (PANS OPS) and 
comply with EUROCONTROL guidelines for the design of Terminal Procedures for Area Navigation. The supporting 
navigation infrastructure is GNSS and INS/IRS as permitted by the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and/ or approved 
by the appropriate regulatory authority. Use of DME/DME is acceptable at higher levels, where navigation accuracy 
of +/- 1NM can be maintained, however due to the lack of DME facilities DME/DME cannot be relied upon to provide 
a navigation solution at lower levels. Operators which have obtained operational and airworthiness approval, from 
their regulatory authority, may operate the RNAV SID and STAR procedures in accordance with the conditions of 
approval including:
  • P-RNAV certified aircraft;
  • B-RNAV certified aircraft only above MSA;
Climb to MSA on the initial segments of the RNAV SID may be conducted using conventional navigation. 
If the RNAV equipment fails, or navigation accuracy of +/-1 NM can not be maintained, inform ATC as soon as 
possible.
2.2. RTF Phraseology
Phraseology used will be as provided in the European Regional Supplementary Procedures (ICAO Doc 7030) and 
outlined in EUROCONTROL Guidance material for RNAV SID and STAR.
Examples of phraseology for ATC are:  
{CALLSIGN} CLEARED {STAR designator} ARRIVAL, RUNWAY {designator}.
Note: On such a clearance flight crew shall continue on route until reaching start point of the STAR. 
{CALLSIGN} ADVISE IF ABLE {designator} DEPARTURE [or ARRIVAL].
If ATC are unable to issue a requested SID or STAR: 
{CALLSIGN} UNABLE TO ISSUE (designator) DEPARTURE [or ARRIVAL] DUE [Reason]
Examples of pilot phraseology in the event of being unable to accept SID or STAR 
UNABLE (designator) DEPARTURE [or ARRIVAL] DUE TO RNAV TYPE.

appropriate hold.
5.2.2. Descent into the FIR (Class G Uncontrolled airspace)
Where possible IFR traffic into EIKN should not request descent into the FIR as the Shannon CTA has been 
designed to facilitate continuous descent and climb operations in controlled airspace.
However in the event that descent is requested by IFR aircraft below FL080 before the lateral limits of the EIKN CTR
or associated stubs, such descent, if requested, may be given at pilot's discretion with a clearance to re-enter 
controlled airspace at or descending to a specified level/altitude agreed with ATC. Flight information in the FIR is 
available from Shannon ATS on 127.500MHz
  • Arrival routes may be varied at the discretion of ATC
  • Arrival Routes are based on holding patterns for the runway in use as outlined on the appropriate chart.
  • ATC EIKN will issue expected approach times as appropriate a nd aircraft will arrange flight in such a manner 
as to ensure prompt departure from the holding pattern when number one.
  • Aircraft will arrange flight in the holding pattern so as to  be ready to leave the appropriate hold inbound to the 
fix and to vacate holding altitude at the last acknowledged expected approach time.
5.2.3. Successive arriving IFR aircraft
A minimum of 10NM spacing is required for successive landing IFR aircraft to facilitate the No.1 landing aircraft to 
vacate via taxiway A onto the apron. This may be increased or reduced at the discretion of the duty controller at 
EIKN.
Aircraft after landing on Runway 26 may be required to roll to the runway turn pad before commencing backtrack 
and to vacate onto Taxiway A. Where temperatures are above 25°C aircraft will not be permitted to carry out 180 
degree turns on the runway and will have to roll to the  runway turn pad before commencing their turn and backtrack.

aircraft is unable to comply with Standard Instrument Departure the phraseology “Unable to comply with {departure} 
due {reasons}” Pilots who cannot comply with Standard Instrument Departures shall advise ATC in good time using 
the phraseology “Unable to comply with {departure} due {reasons}, so that alternative clearances can be issued.
7.4. Communications failure procedures for departing aircraft.
Aircraft experiencing communications failure in Connaught CTR shall set transponder code A7600 and comply with 
the following procedures:
RFL below FL080: 
Departing traffic cleared by ATC to a level/altitude below the RFL, shall comply with Communication failure 
procedures as outlined in ICAO Annex 2.
RFL FL080 or above: 
Departing traffic cleared by ATC to a level or altitude below FL080 shall maintain the cleared level for a period of 
three minutes following the time the altitude/level is reached and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance 
with filed flight plan. Departing Traffic experiencing a communications failure above FL080 shall comply with 
communications failure procedures as outlined in ICAO Annex 2
8. Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures and Low Visibility Pr ocedures
Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures and Low Visibility Procedures are approved for operations on Runway 26 
and for Runway 08. Only R26 is available for CAT II approaches.
8.1. Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures (RAVP)
Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures come into effect when
A. The IRVR and/or Met Visibility falls below 1500m and/or
B. When the Duty Air Traffic Control Officer (DATCO) loses visua l contact with any part of the manoeuvring area 
but LVP’s are not in force and/or
C. When the conditions for Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) no lo nger exist but may become applicable in the 
short term.

The Maximum allowable movement rate on the manoeuvring area when RAVPs are in force is 3 (2 aircraft and 1 
vehicle or 2 vehicles and 1 aircraft) Minimum spacing between aircraft on approach when RAVPs are in force will 
be 20nm
8.2. Low Visibility Procedures
8.2.1. Low Visibility Procedures will be initiated if Met Visibi lity and/or any of the IRVR readings are at or less than 1000m 
and is forecast to deteriorate significantly and/or the cloud ceiling is 300ft or less (BKN, OVC).
8.2.2. Low Visibility Procedures shall be enforced when Met Visi bility and / or any of the IRVR readings are at or less than 
700m, and / or the cloud ceiling is at or less than 200ft (BKN, OVC).
8.2.3. Low Visibility Procedures will be terminated after all IR VR readings have been above 1000m and the cloud ceiling 
has been above 300 ft for at least 30 minutes and the forecast is for a continuing improvement. RAVPs will be take 
effect if visibility remains below 1500m (see section 1).
8.2.4. The Maximum allowable movement rate on the Manoeuvring ar ea when LVPs are in force is 1 (aircraft or vehicle).
8.2.5. The runway holding positions at TWY A and TWY B are Cat I I holding positions.
8.2.6. Aircraft should advise when clear of the runway after lan ding and when airborne
8.2.7. Minimum spacing between aircraft on approach will be 20NM
8.2.8. Pilots will be informed by RTF when low visibility proced ures have been enforced. 
8.2.9. Full details of low visibility operations are available f rom airport administration on request.
9. Communication Failure
In the event of communication failure, the pilot shall act in accordance with the communication failure procedures in 
ICAO Annex 2.
Radio communication failure missed approach for RWY08 and RWY26 are prescribed on the approach charts 
10. VFR communication failure for inbound aircraft
If an aircraft has received and acknowledged an ATC clearance to enter the Connaught Control Zone and 
subsequently experiences a radio-communications failure, the aircraft should proceed to the position specified in 
the clearance, e.g. from the South route via Ballyhaunis to the Kilkelly hold, or from the North route via Tobercurry 
to the Charlestown hold, and hold at an altitude of 1200 feet QNH at "Kilkelly" or 1200 feet QNH at “Charlestown”. 
Both holding patterns are left hand patterns. A careful look-out should be maintained for other traffic and on receipt 
of a steady green light signal from the Tower, or on observing the Aerodrome rotating beacon switched on, join the 
circuit for the runway in use and land on the lighted runway. The runway approach lights will indicate the landing 
direction.
Note: All flights planning to enter or leave the Connaught Control zone are required to file a flight plan. 
Communications failure in the Circuit: 
If clearance to land has been received and acknowledged, or if cleared to follow identified No.1 traffic, follow the 
clearance. If no landing clearance has been received, proceed at an altitude of 1200 feet QNH to Kilkelly (Rwy 26 
in use) or 1200 feet QNH to Charlestown (Rwy 08 in use) and hold. The choice of holding point will depend upon 
Runway in use and the point at which radio-communications failure occurs. The holding point chosen should ensure 
that the aircraft does not pass through the final approach or take-off path of the main runway in use i.e. the runway 
being used by large aircraft. On receipt of a steady green light signal from the Tower, or on observing the Aerodrome 
rotating beacon switched on, join the circuit in the manner detailed below and land on the lighted Runway. The 
runway approach lights will indicate the landing direction.

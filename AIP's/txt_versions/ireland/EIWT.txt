Note:
i. Care must be taken not to penetrate the R15, R16 or the Dublin CTA/CTR. RTF contact with Baldonnel 
should not be attempted while on the ground at Weston.
ii. Aircraft must avoid over-flying the Technology Campus and the Industrial Complex.
Weston VFR Route from the East
Dublin Visual Approach Chart (EIDW AD 2.24-44) shows a Weston VFR Route along a DVOR/DME visual track to 
Weston Airport from the East. This track follows the inbound course of the Radial 098 to Weston DVOR/DME (‘WST’ 
114.7 CH94X). Aircraft utilising this track must at all times exercise due caution with regard to the following:
a. The routing along the inbound course is strictly VFR and Visu al Flight Rules apply at all times;
b. Pilots must maintain awareness of the proximity of Restricted  Areas EIR15 and EIR23 south of the VFR 
route;
c. ATS will be provided by Dublin ATC and transfer of communicat ions to Weston ATC will be at the discretion 
of Dublin ATC;
d. Routing crosses EIP11 vertical limits GND to 1000ft AMSL and in close proximity to EIP18 vertical limits 
surface to 550 ft AMSL, pilots must exercise caution accordingly.
Special VFR is available within Weston AOR in accordance with SERA.5010 and the provisions of S.I. No. 266 of 
2019.
1.2 IFR Arrival Procedures (Dublin CTA requires RNAV1 standard f or IFR Operations)
Non-RNAV aircraft must request DATCC to radar vector to the start point of the approach.
Non-RNAV equipped aircraft will be assigned a clearance based on conventional navigation aids and/or vectoring.
1.2.1 Entry Points
As all EIWT procedures operate within the EIDW (Dublin) CTA/CTR, consult EIDW charts in planning all arrivals and 
departures at EIWT. Unless preflight co-ordination has been affected, entry to controlled airspace shall be made at 
an approved entry point. The procedures described below are designed to integrate IFR arrivals to, or departures 
from Weston into the Dublin CTA air traffic management strategy.
1.2.2 Clearance to enter the Dublin CTA and CTR
To enter the EIDW (Dublin) CTA/CTR, consult EIDW charts. Arriving IFR traffic for EIWT may be cleared to a RNAV 
hold from which there is no Weston Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP). In this instance aircraft will be radar 
vectored to intercept the appropriate IAP for EIWT.
1.2.3 Initial Approach Procedures:
  • With Radar Control:
In order to expedite the flow of traffic, aircraft may receive radar vectors on to final approach.
  • Without Radar Control:
When arriving traffic cannot be sequenced by radar, aircraft will be cleared to join the appropriate IAF for EIWT from 
the associated hold. This procedure is not available to non-RNAV equipped aircraft.
1.2.4 Communications Failure procedures for arriving aircraft to  EIWT:
Aircraft experiencing communications failure in the Dublin CTA/CTR shall set transponder code A7600 and comply 
with standard ICAO procedures, supplemented by the following:
  • Traffic radar vectored on the arrival route:
03 OCT 2024
AIRAC Amdt 009/24

=== Page 10 ===
EIWT AD 2 - 10 AIP IRELAND
AIRNAV IRELAND
Aircraft being radar vectored on the arrival route should proceed in the most expeditious manner and complete the 
IAP appropriate to EIWT and land at EIWT.
  • Traffic radar vectored to final approach:
Aircraft being radar vectored to final approach should join, in the most expeditious manner, and complete the IAP 
appropriate to EIWT and land at EIWT.
If unable to comply with the above, carry out the appropriate missed approach procedure for the EIWT IAP in use. 
Upon completion, aircraft should follow the stated IAP to EIDW in accordance with the relevant EIDW IAP chart.
1.2.5 Procedures for missed approach from EIWT IAP in the event of radio failure:
All aircraft (including non-RNAV aircraft) should execute the missed approach procedure in accordance with the 
relevant EIWT IAP chart. Upon completion, aircraft should follow the stated IAP to EIDW in accordance with the 
relevant EIDW IAP chart.
2. Departure Procedures
2.1 SIDs (Standard Instrument Departures)
RNAV Equipped Aircraft 
SID for RWY07 has been developed in accordance with ICAO Doc 8168 (PANS OPS) and comply with 
EUROCONTROL guidelines for the design of Terminal Procedures for Area Navigation. The supporting navigation 
infrastructure is GNSS and INS/IRS as permitted by the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and/ or approved by the 
appropriate regulatory authority. Use of DME/DME is acceptable where navigation accuracy of +/- 1NM can be 
maintained. Operators which have obtained operational and airworthiness approval from their Competent Authority 
may operate the RNAV SID procedures in accordance with the conditions of approval. If the RNAV equipment fails, 
or navigation accuracy of +/-1 NM cannot be maintained, inform ATC as soon as possible.
2.2 RWY07- PESIT 1A SID07 is only  available when Dublin Airport (EIDW) is using Runway 10 L/R.
If the aircraft cannot comply with the SID, then Weston ATS shall inform the Dublin Traffic Manager as to the nature 
of the restriction the departure is operating under. The Dublin Traffic Manager will take this restriction into 
consideration when issuing the new departure clearance.
2.3 Standard Departure Routes for fixed wing and helicopters are :
Visual Departure Route to West
  • Runway 25: 
Climb straight ahead to 650 ft. QNH. Turn right no later than reaching end of reservoir to follow M4 motorway 
climbing to 1000 ft. QNH and exit controlled airspace. Remain South of Maynooth.
  • Runway 07: 
Climb straight ahead to 650ft. QNH and join the Weston circuit climbing to 1000ft. QNH downwind. At the 
end of the downwind leg turn right no later than reaching end of reservoir to follow the M4 motorway. Remain 
South of Maynooth.
Note:
i. Departing traffic wishing to penetrate the R15, R16, or the Dublin CTA/CTR should follow the Standard 
Departure Route to Maynooth, and establish RTF by Maynooth for appropriate clearance.
ii. Care must be taken not to penetrate the R15, R16 or the Dublin CTA/CTR. RTF contact with Baldonnel 
should not be attempted while on the ground at Weston.
iii. Aircraft must avoid over-flying the Technology Campus and the Industrial Complex.
3. Rules and Procedures for Navigation within the Weston Area of  Responsibility

EIWT AD 2.23 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Weston is a busy VFR airfield located 8 NM from Dublin airport and 3 NM from Casement Military Airport. There 
have been instances of inadvertent penetration of controlled and restricted airspace by aircraft operating to/from 
Weston.
An aircraft which is unsure of position when flying in proximity to Weston should take action to avoid inadvertent 
penetration of controlled and restricted airspace. If during a flight, a pilot becomes aware that an aircraft has 
inadvertently penetrated controlled or restricted airspace, then Dublin ATC or Baldonnel ATC, as appropriate, must 
be contacted, without delay, and provided with relevant information.
Every operator of aircraft using Weston aerodrome must ensure that aircraft are operated in a manner calculated to 
cause the least disturbance practicable to areas surrounding the airport.
Prior permission for use of Weston must be obtained. Filing of a flight plan does not constitute prior permission. A 
Booking-in Form or Booking-out Form, as appropriate, is mandatory for use of Weston. These are available from the 
Weston Operations Office

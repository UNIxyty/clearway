EISG AD 2.20 LOCAL TRAFFIC REGULATIONS
1. EQUIPMENT REQUREMENTS
1. TMZ  
All flights operating in the Sligo TMZ shall carry and operate SSR transponders capable of operating on Modes A 
and C or on Mode S, unless in compliance with alternative provisions prescribed by Sligo ATS that has been 
designated for the airspace as outlined above. See Non-Radio Aircraft & Non-Transponder Aircraft Section 4.
2. RMZ  
All flights operating in the Sligo RMZ shall maintain continuous air-ground voice communication watch and establish 
two-way communication, as necessary, on the appropriate communication channel, unless in compliance with 
alternative provisions prescribed for that particular airspace by Sligo ATS. See Non-Radio Aircraft & Non-
Transponder Aircraft Section 4.
3. RMZ Entry  
The requirements for entry into an RMZ are detailed in SERA.6005 (a) as follows:  
Before entering a radio mandatory zone, an initial call containing: 
a. the designation of the station being called;
b. callsign;
c. type of aircraft;
d. position;
e. level;
f. the intentions of the flight; And;
g. Other information as prescribed by the competent authority sh all be made by pilots on the appropriate 
communication channel. [Ref EISG AD 2.19]
Once this information has been passed to and acknowledged by AFIS, a pilot may enter the RMZ. However, if a pilot 
is requested to ‘stand by’ before the required information is passed; they must remain outside of the RMZ. AFIS will 
resume communications with pilots as soon as possible after having instructed them to ‘stand by’.
Whilst operating within an RMZ pilots are required to continuously monitor the published frequency. This is to raise 
situational awareness for all and offers a means of communication between pilot and AFIS if required. 
Sligo AFIS may additionally instruct an aircraft with a functioning transponder to squawk an appropriate code.
4. Radio and/or Transponder Failure
4.1. A VFR flight experiencing radio failure prior to entry into  the RMZ is required to remain outside the RMZ and route 
to their alternate aerodrome. The pilot shall contact Sligo Air Traffic Services +353 71 9168461 as soon as 
practicable on landing.
4.2. A VFR flight experiencing radio failure whilst inside the R MZ is required to route to,
1. If approaching from the North, route to the Drumcliff Church Hold at or below 1500ft and await light signals 
from Sligo AFIS.
2. If approaching from the South, route to the Beltra Hold at or  below 1500ft and await light signals from Sligo 
AFIS.
4.3. SAR aircraft on an IFR flight experiencing radio failure ar e required to follow Rule 31 Communications Failure, AIP 
Ireland ENR 1.3 INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES
4.4. An aircraft experiencing transponder failure shall advise S ligo AFIS as soon as practicable when aware of the failure. 
Prevailing traffic conditions may delay TMZ entry/departure.
4.5. Aircraft experiencing both Radio and Transponder failure ar e required to follow Parts 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 as appropriate to 
their flight rules.
5. Non-Radio Aircraft & Non-Transponder Aircraft

Pilots of aircraft which are neither non-transponder nor non-radio equipped must contact Sligo Air Traffic Services 
+353 71 9168461 in order to seek agreement to operate within the TMZ.
Prevailing traffic conditions may preclude TMZ entry agreement to non-transponder aircraft (or an aircraft with a non
-functioning transponder) to operate within the TMZ.
Ref: SERA.6005 Requirements for communications and SSR transponder. 
SERA.13001 Operation of a transponder. 
SERA 13020 SSR transponder failure when the carriage of a transponder is mandatory.

facilitate passage of aircraft to turnaround areas beyond each threshold.

EISG AD 2.22 FLIGHT PROCEDURES
1. Arrival Procedures
Clearance to enter the CTR
Shannon ATS will clear arriving traffic to descend to the lowest usable flight level within controlled airspace (FL080/
Shannon Transition level if higher).  EISG ATC will provide the transition altitude and QNH. All aircraft below the 
transition altitude should use the QNH provided.
A lower level/altitude within controlled airspace may be coordinated with Sligo ATC. Clearance to enter the CTR will 
be provided by ATC EISG on 122.100MHz. Arriving aircraft too call no later than 25DME SLG from EISG.
Descent into the FIR (Class G Uncontrolled airspace) 
Caution: Descent below FL080 or Transition level if higher, before the lateral limits of the Control Zone or associated 
stubs as outlined in ENR 2.1 will bring the flight into Shannon Class G (uncontrolled) airspace. There may be traffic 
operating in this airspace that is unknown and not operating with a transponder. Such descent, if requested, may be 
given at pilot’s discretion with a clearance to re-enter controlled airspace at or descending to a specified level/altitude 
agreed with ATC. Flight information in the FIR is available from Shannon ATS on 127.500MHz
Arrival routes may be varied at the discretion of ATC. Arrival Routes are based on the holding pattern established 
at SLG.
EISG ATC will issue expected approach times as appropriate for use in the event of a communication failure.
2. Holding Procedures
Holding Areas as depicted on Instrument Approach Charts. 
3. Communication Failure
In the event of communication failure, the pilot shall act in accordance with the communication failure procedures in 
ICAO Annex 2.
4. Visual Approach Chart (VAC)

Aerodrome habitat work takes place on the grass areas periodically through out the year. Pilots are warned of the 
presence of sea birds in the approach area to Runway 28 (take-of area for Runway 10). There is a constant bird 
hazard on the tidal mud flats adjacent to the aerodrome, which can increase at short notice as concentrations of 
migratory birds move through the area.
During the winter months OCT-MAR, large flocks of Barnacle Geese may be encountered North of Sligo Airport in 
the vicinity of Ballyygilgan Nature Reserve (Lissadell), 542048N 0083293W, Ballyconnell/Raghly, 542149N 
0083986W and Inishmurry Island. Pilots are advised to exercise caution and avoid unnecessary overflight both day 
and night.

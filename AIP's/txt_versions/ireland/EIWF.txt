aircraft are exempt from this requirement.
8. Equipment Requirements
1. TMZ  
All flights operating in the Waterford TMZ shall carry and operate SSR transponders capable of operating on 
Modes A and C or on Mode S, unless in compliance with alternative provisions prescribed by Waterford ATS 
that has been designated for the airspace as outlined above. Refer to Item 5 hereunder.
2. RMZ  
All flights operating in the Waterford RMZ shall maintain continuous air-ground voice communication watch 
and establish two-way communication, as necessary, on the appropriate communication channel, unless in 
compliance with alternative provisions prescribed for that particular airspace by Waterford ATS. Refer to Item 
4 hereunder.
3. RMZ Entry  
The requirements for entry into an RMZ are detailed in SERA.6005 (a) as follows: 
Before entering a radio mandatory zone, an initial call containing: 
a. the designation of the station being called; 
b. callsign;
c. type of aircraft;
d. position;
e. level;
f. the intentions of the flight;  
And;
g. Other information as prescribed by the competent authority sh all be made by pilots on the appropriate 
communication channel. [Ref EIWF AD 2.18]
Once this information has been passed to and acknowledged by AFIS, a pilot may enter the RMZ. However, if a pilot 
is requested to 'stand by' before the required information is passed; they must remain outside of the RMZ. AFIS will 
resume communications with pilots as soon as possible after having instructed them to 'stand by'.
Whilst operating within an RMZ pilots are required to continuously monitor the published frequency. This is to raise 
situational awareness for all and offers a means of communication between pilot and AFIS if required. 
Waterford AFIS may additionally instruct an aircraft with a functioning transponder to squawk an appropriate code.
4. Radio and/or Transponder Failure
4.1 A VFR flight experiencing radio failure prior to entry into the RMZ is required to remain outside the 
RMZ and route to their alternate aerodrome. The pilot shall contact Waterford Air Traffic Services 
+353 51 846613 as soon as practicable on landing.
4.2 A VFR flight experiencing radio failure whilst inside the RM Z is required to route to,
4.2.1 If approaching from the East route via Baginbun Head not above 1,500 ft to the Belle Lake 
Hold and await light signals from Waterford AFIS,
4.2.2 If approaching from the West, route via Bunmahon not above 1,500 ft to the Tramore 
Racecourse Hold and await light signals from Waterford AFIS.
4.3 SAR aircraft on an IFR flight experiencing radio failure are  required   to follow Rule 31 
Communications Failure, AIP Ireland ENR 1.3 INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES.
4.4 An aircraft experiencing transponder failure shall advise Wa terford AFIS as soon as practicable when 
aware of the failure. Prevailing traffic conditions may delay TMZ entry/departure.
4.5 Aircraft experiencing both Radio and Transponder failure are  required to follow Parts 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 as 
20 FEB 2025

appropriate to their flight rules.
5. Non-Radio Aircraft & Non-Transponder Aircraft  
Pilots of aircraft which are neither non-transponder nor non-radio equipped must contact Waterford Air Traffic 
Services +353 51 846613 in order to seek agreement to operate within the TMZ. 
Prevailing traffic conditions may preclude TMZ entry agreement to non-transponder aircraft (or an aircraft 
with a non-functioning transponder) to operate within the TMZ.

NIL
EIWF AD 2.22 FLIGHT PROCEDURES
1. Arrival Procedures
Clearance to enter the CTR.Arrival routes may be varied at the discretion of ATC.
Arrival Routes are based on holding patterns established at Waterford.
Shannon ATS will descend arriving traffic to the lowest usable flight level within controlled airspace (FL080 / 
Shannon Transition level if higher).
A lower level/altitude within controlled airspace may be coordinated with Waterford ATC.
Descent into the FIR (Class G Uncontrolled airspace) 
Caution: Descent below FL080 or Transition level if higher, before the lateral limits of the Control Zone or associated 
stubs as outlined in ENR 2.1 will bring the flight into Shannon Class G (uncontrolled) airspace. There may be traffic 
operating in this airspace that is unknown and not operating with a transponder. Such descent, if requested, may be 
given at pilot’s discretion with a clearance to re-enter controlled airspace at or descending to a specified level/altitude 
agreed with ATC. Flight information in the FIR is available from Shannon ATS on 127.500 MHz
2. Communication Failure
In the event of communication failure, the pilot shall act in accordance with the communication failure procedures in 
ICAO Annex 2.
3. Departure Procedures
AD not available for departures when official met visibility is below 550m, SAR aircraft exempt.
4. EIWF Instrument Approach Procedures
ILS CAT 1, LOC RWY 21 and NDB RWY 03 Instrument Approach only available when Air Traffic Control Zone is 
active unless the operator has prior approval from the Irish Aviation Authority and Waterford Airport Management.

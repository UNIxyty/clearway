1.1 Holding Areas  
Protected airspace is provided for Holding Areas in accordance with the criteria contained in PANS-OPS ICAO Doc 
8168, Volume II for basic holding areas.
1.2 SID and STAR
1.2.1 RNAV Equipped Aircraft
SIDs and STARs for RWY16 and RWY34 have been developed in accordance with ICAO Doc 8168 (PANS OPS) 
and comply with Eurocontrol guidelines for the design of Terminal Procedures for Area Navigation.
The supporting navigation infrastructure is GNSS and INS/IRS as permitted by the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and/
or approved by the appropriate regulatory authority.
Use of DME/DME is acceptable at higher levels, where navigation accuracy of +/- 1NM can be maintained, however 
due to the lack of DME facilities DME/DME can not be relied upon to provide a navigation solution at lower levels. 
Operators which have obtained operational and airworthiness approval, from their regulatory authority, may operate 
the RNAV SID and STAR procedures in accordance with the conditions of approval including:
  • P-RNAV certified aircraft;
  • B-RNAV certified aircraft only above MSA;
Climb to MSA on the initial segments of the RNAV SIDs may be conducted using conventional navigation.
If the RNAV equipment fails, or navigation accuracy of +/-1 NM can not be maintained, inform ATC as soon as 
possible. Radar vectoring will be provided.
1.2.2 RTF Phraseology
Phraseology used will be as provided in the European Regional Supplementary Procedures (ICAO Doc 7030) and 
outlined in Eurocontrol Guidance material for RNAV SIDs and STARs.
Examples of phraseology for ATC are:
{CALLSIGN} CLEARED {STAR designator} ARRIVAL, RUNWAY {designator}
Note:  On such a clearance flight crew shall continue on route until reaching start point of the STAR.
{CALLSIGN} ADVISE IF ABLE {designator} DEPARTURE [or ARRIVAL].
If ATC are unable to issue a requested SID or STAR:
{CALLSIGN} UNABLE TO ISSUE (designator) DEPARTURE [or ARRIVAL] DUE [Reason]

Visual manoeuvring (circling) approaches are permissible, on request, to all runways.
2. Speed Control - General Provisions  
Speed Restrictions
3. Arrival Procedures
3.1 Clearance to enter the CTA and CTR
Aircraft flying the ATS Route system will be cleared into the CTA/CTR associated with Cork without having to 
request a specific entry clearance.
Arriving Aircraft for RWY 16/34 capable of flying STARs will normally be cleared on a STAR appropriate to the route 
by ATC. On occasions ATC may radar vector aircraft for arrival (Due traffic or technical reasons).
Arriving aircraft for RWY 07/25 will be vectored to join the approach.
3.2 Initial Approach Procedures
  • With Radar Control  
In order to expedite the flow of traffic, aircraft may be cleared on STARs, or may receive radar vectors on to 
final approach track from the hold or earlier on the Standard Arrival Route. 
Pilots should plan their flight profile in such a manner as to be able to achieve the Minimum Holding Level at 
the appropriate hold 
Actual descent clearance will be as directed by ATC.
  • Without Radar Control  
When RADAR is not serviceable, aircraft will be cleared to join the instrument approach procedure 
appropriate to the landing direction from the appropriate hold.
  • Communications failure procedures for arriving aircraft  
Aircraft experiencing communications failure in the Shannon CTR/CTA shall set transponder code A7600 
and comply with standard ICAO procedures. 
Supplemented by the following:
  • Traffic cleared on STAR  
Aircraft cleared on a STAR and experiencing a Communications failure shall follow the route of the 
STAR at the last cleared level or altitude. On reaching the appropriate hold fix, descend to 3000ft and 
complete the instrument approach procedure appropriate to the Runway in use.
  • Traffic Radar vectored to final approach
1. Aircraft being radar vectored to final approach should join, in the most expeditious manner, 
and complete the Instrument Approach procedure appropriate to the Runway in use.

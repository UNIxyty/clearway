1. Aircraft Taxiing
Pilots should use the minimum power necessary while taxiing. On west apron stands 1 to 5, pilots should operate 
at the minimum power commensurate with the intended manoeuvre, due to the effect of jet blast on personnel, 
equipment and buildings.
2. Aircraft Engine Test Runs
Permission for all test runs must be obtained from the ATC 
 
Aircraft engine test runs at idle speed not exceeding five minutes duration are permitted on the west apron stand 1 
and stand 2, and on the east apron stand E2 and stand E3 locations as indicated on Kerry aerodrome chart EIKY 
AD 2.24-1.
Engine test runs up to full power shall take place in the isolated area parking (IAP) location as indicated on Kerry

EIKY AD 2.21 NOISE ABATEMENT PROCEDURES
Turbojet aircraft may operate only between the hours of 0730 and 2300 (UTC) during the period 1st October to 31st 
May. Operation is unrestricted during the period 1st June to 30th September.
EIKY AD 2.22 FLIGHT PROCEDURES
1. Arrival Procedures
Clearance to enter the CTR
Arrival routes may be varied at the discretion of ATC.
Arrival Routes are based on holding patterns established at KER NDB and ROTSO.
Shannon ATS will descend arriving traffic to the lowest usable flight level within controlled airspace (FL 080 / 
Shannon Transition level if higher).
A lower level/altitude within controlled airspace may be coordinated with Kerry ATC.
Descent into the FIR (Class G Uncontrolled airspace) 
Caution: Descent below FL080 or Transition level if higher, before the lateral limits of the Shannon CTA, Kerry 
Control Zone or associated stubs as outlined in ENR 2.1 will bring the flight into Shannon Class G (uncontrolled) 
airspace. There may be traffic operating in this airspace that is unknown and not operating with a transponder. Such 
descent, if requested, may be given at pilot’s discretion with a clearance to re-enter controlled airspace at or 
descending to a specified level/altitude agreed with ATC. Flight information in the FIR is available from Shannon 
ATS on 127.500MHz
2. Communication Failure
In the event of communication failure, the pilot shall act in accordance with the communication failure procedures in 
ICAO Annex 2 supplemented by the following:
Traffic departing on Kerry SID SHA3A, SHA3B, SHA3C, SHA3D, CRK3A, CRK3B, CRK3C, CRK3D, KER3A, KER 
3B, KER3C & KER3D, experiencing radio communication failure in the Kerry CTR/Shannon CTA shall maintain the 
maximum altitude specified in the SID for a period of three minutes following the time the altitude is reached and 
thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with filed flight plan
3. OMNI-DIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE PROCEDURE FOR RUNWAYS 08/26
Pilots who cannot comply with any of the SID’s or Omnidirectional departure procedures must inform ATC in good 
time so alternative clearances can be issued.
Terrain
a. Departing aircraft requiring a deviation from there clearance , published SID or Omnidirectional departure, 
should exercise caution due high ground.
b. Deviation from the published procedures required by departing  aircraft will, on request, be approved by ATC 
“At pilots Discretion”. Warning of high ground.
4. Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures and Low Visibility Pr ocedures 
Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures are approved for operations on Runway 26 and for Runway 08.

4.1 Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures (RAVP) 
Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures come into effect when 
A. The IRVR and/or Met Visibility falls below 1500m and/or 
B. When all or part of the manoeuvring area is not visible to th e Duty Air Traffic Control 
     Officer (DATCO) from the control tower.
The Maximum allowable movement rate on the manoeuvring area when RAVPs are in force is 3 (2 aircraft and 1 
vehicle or 2 vehicles and 1 aircraft).
4.2 Low visibility procedures (LVP)
Kerry airport are not approved for low visibility procedures and therefore do not operate in low visibility conditions 
(LVC)
Where the reported conditions are below the operational minima of RVR ≤550M or height of cloud ≤200ft, Aircraft 
arrival and departure operations shall be suspended.

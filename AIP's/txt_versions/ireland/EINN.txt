Visual manoeuvring (circling) approaches are permissible, on request, to all runways.
4. Speed Control – General Provisions  
Speed Restrictions
5. Arrival Procedures
5.1 Clearance to enter the CTA and CTR
Arriving Aircraft capable of flying STAR will normally be cleared on a STAR appropriate to the route by ATC. On 
occasions ATC may radar vector aircraft for arrival (Due traffic or technical reasons).
Standard Arrivals Routes used in the Shannon CTA are based on Holding Patterns at DERAG and ELPOM.
5.2 Initial Approach Procedures.
5.2.1 With Radar Control
In order to expedite the flow of traffic, aircraft may be cleared on STAR, or may receive radar vectors on to final 
approach track from the hold or earlier on the Standard Arrival Route.
Pilots should plan their flight profile in such a manner as to be able to achieve the Minimum Holding Level at the 
appropriate hold.
Actual descent clearance will be as directed by ATC.
5.2.2 Shannon (EINN) Arrivals - Caution - Shannon Approach Airsp ace is a Level Bust Hotspot Area. Ensure altimeter set 
to Hectopascals (HPA) when instructed by Shannon Approach.
5.2.2.1 Surveillance Minimum Altitude Chart (EINN AD 2.24-16.1)  
ALTITUDE TEMPERATURE CORRECTION TO 0°C is taken into account in determining minimums. For 
temperatures below 0°C altitude correction will be managed by ATC.
5.2.3 Without Radar Control.  
When RADAR is not serviceable, aircraft will be cleared to join the instrument approach procedure appropriate to 
the landing direction from the appropriate hold.
5.2.4 Communications failure procedures for arriving aircraft.
Aircraft experiencing communications failure in the Shannon CTR/CTA shall set transponder code A7600 and 
comply with standard ICAO procedures.
Supplemented by the following:
Traffic cleared on STAR 
Aircraft cleared on a STAR and experiencing a Communications failure shall follow the route of the STAR at the last 
cleared level or altitude. On reaching the appropriate hold fix, descend to 3000ft and complete the instrument 
approach procedure appropriate to the Runway in use.

Traffic Radar vectored to final approach 
Aircraft being radar vectored to final approach should join, in the most expeditious manner, and complete the 
Instrument Approach procedure appropriate to the Runway in use.
If unable to comply with above, or uncertain of position, climb to 3000ft QNH, proceed in the most expeditious 
manner to the hold appropriate to the Runway in use and complete the Instrument Approach Procedure appropriate 
to the Runway in Use
6. Departure Procedures
6.1 RWY’s 06 and 24
Aircraft capable of complying with Standard Instrument Departures will proceed in accordance with the SID.
If an aircraft is unable to comply with Standard Instrument Departure the phraseology “Unable to comply with 
{departure} due {reasons}”
Pilots who cannot comply with Standard Instrument Departures shall advise ATC in good time using the phraseology 
“Unable to comply with {departure} due {reasons}, so that alternative clearances can be issued.
6.2 OMNI-Directional Departures:
Aircraft subject to an OMNI Directional Departures instruction from RWY 06 and RWY 24 climb straight ahead to 
5000ft, then depart on track as cleared by ATC, maintain a minimum climb gradient of 6.6% for ATM (400ft/NM) 
(minimum 3.7% for obstacle clearance). CAUTION: Close-in obstacles (Terrain and Trees) exist.
6.3 Communications failure procedures for departing aircraft.
Aircraft experiencing communications failure in Shannon CTA/CTR shall set transponder code A7600 and comply 
with the following procedures:
*RFL below FL080: Departing traffic cleared by ATC to a level/altitude below the *RFL, shall comply with 
Communication failure procedures as outlined in ICAO Annex 2.
*RFL FL080 or above: Departing traffic cleared by ATC to a level or altitude below FL080 shall maintain the cleared 
level for a period of three minutes following the time the altitude/level is reached and thereafter adjust level and 
speed in accordance with filed flight plan.
Departing Traffic experiencing a communications failure above FL080 shall comply with communications failure 
procedures as outlined in ICAO Annex 2
7. Low Visibility Procedures
7.1 Low Visibility Procedures apply when the cloud ceiling is be low 200ft (60M) and/or the IRVR is less than 550M.
7.2 Only RWY 24 may be used for CAT II operations. The CAT II ho lding position on TWY D2 must be used.
7.3 When these procedures are in operation and RWY 24 is in use the following standard taxi route system applies:
  • Departing aircraft shall normally use TWY’s D1 and D2.
  • Arriving aircraft shall normally use TWY A.
7.4 During LVP Operations, LVTOs are permitted from Runway 24. I t is at the discretion of the PIC to depart based on 
their airline operating procedures in LVP conditions. Take-offs are not available in IRVR conditions below 125M. All 
IRVR readings must show 125M or greater. ATC shall inform departing pilots if and when any IRVR value falls below 
125M.
7.5 TWY/Stop-bar/Centreline lighting/Lead on/Lead off will be in  use. At no time shall an aircraft or vehicle cross an 
illuminated stop bar and any instruction to do so should be challenged. In exceptional circumstances when the stop 
bar cannot be extinguished the authorisation to cross the illuminated stop bar may be given by ATS. This shall 
always be challenged and confirmation received that this instruction is part of a contingency arrangement due to a 
failure of the stop bar. All aircraft and vehicles operators shall request for the instruction to cross an illuminated stop

EIDL AD 2 - 8 AIP IRELAND

EIDL AD 2.20 LOCAL TRAFFIC REGULATIONS
1. Landing, take-off, manoeuvring on the Aerodrome outside publi shed opening hours is illegal unless such permission 
has been obtained in advance or in the event of an emergency.
2. Runway Operations and RED Runway Operational and Runway End L ights
The end of the TORA and LDA for Runway 02 is marked by a row of inset RED Runway Operational lights across 
the northern part of the runway, 129M from the north end of the runway pavement.
The end of the TORA and LDA for Runway 20 is marked by a row of inset RED Runway Operational lights across 
the southern part of the runway, 163M from the south end of the runway pavement. 
The inset RED lights marking the end of the above declared operational distances are normally energised ON, and 
showing a red colour, when the runway is active at such times when the runway lighting is required.
In addition to these lights, a row of elevated RED Runway END Lights is installed at the extreme ends of the runway 
pavement to mark the physical end of the runway pavement and the limits of the Runway End Turning Areas. These 
Runway END Lights will normally be OFF during take-off and landing operations on the runway, and only illuminated 
by ATC following a landing, or prior to an aircraft commencing its take-off run, in order to mark the end of the 
pavement so that aircraft may safely execute a 180° turn on the pavement in the Runway End Turning Areas.
Aircraft landing on Runway 02 or Runway 20 may, after landing, taxi across the inset RED lights for the purposes 
of turning in the Runway End Turning Areas once ATC has switched ON the red Runway End Lights.  Similarly, for 
aircraft taxiing on the runway to take off from Runway 20, these may taxi across the RED Operational Lights once 
ATC has switched ON the Runway END lights so that a turn may be made in the Runway End Turning Area.
3. The take-off run available (TORA) RWY 02 is displayed on illu minated signs adjacent to the runway.

Shannon ATS will clear arriving traffic to descend to the lowest useable flight level within controlled airspace (FL080/
Shannon Transition level if higher). EIDL ATC will provide the transition altitude and QNH. All aircraft below the 
transition altitude should use the QNH provided.
A lower level/altitude within controlled airspace may be coordinated with Donegal ATC. Clearance to enter the CTR 
will be provided by ATC EIDL on 129.800MHz. Arriving aircraft to call no later than 25 DME IFN from EIDL.
Descent into the FIR (Class G Uncontrolled airspace) 
Caution: Descent below FL080 or Transition level if higher, before the lateral limits of the Control Zone or associated 
stubs as outlined in ENR 2.1   will bring the flight into Shannon Class G (uncontrolled) airspace. There may be traffic 
operating in this airspace that is unknown and not operating with a transponder. Such descent, if requested, may be 
given at pilot’s discretion with a clearance to re-enter controlled airspace at or descending to a specified level/altitude 
agreed with ATC. Flight information in the FIR is available from Shannon ATS on 127.500MHz
Arrival routes may be varied at the discretion of ATC. Arrival Routes are based on the holding pattern established 
at CFN. 
EIDL ATC will issue expected approach times as appropriate for use in the event of a communication failure.
2. Communication Failure
In the event of communication failure, the pilot shall act in accordance with the communication failure procedures in 
ICAO Annex 2.
3. Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures and Low Visibility Pr ocedures
Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures are approved for operations on Runway 02 and for Runway 20.
3.1 Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures (RAVP)
Reduced Aerodrome Visibility Procedures come into effect when:
A. The visibility on any part of the aerodrome is insufficient f or ATC to exercise control over all traffic on the 
basis of visual surveillance; or
B. The visibility on any part of the aerodrome is less than 1400 M.
 
The Maximum allowable movement rate on the manoeuvring area when RAVPs are in force is 3 (2 aircraft and 1
vehicle or 2 vehicles and 1 aircraft).
EIDL AD 2.23 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Strip dimensions and obstacle limitation surfaces are appropriate to a Code Number 2 Non-Precision
Approach Runway. Aircraft operators are to be aware that the full provision of runway strip, i.e. 1562m by 140m is 
not available in the North Eastern portion of the airfield for RWY 20 take-off operations. The full Runway End Safety 
Area (RESA) dimensions, as promulgated are available i.e. 120m x 60m at all times. 
Full distance for RWY strip width is maintained in the RWY 02 direction to 33.5m beyond the end of the runway 
pavement. The fenceline then curves inwards and reduces the strip width to a distance of 36m at the narrowest 
point.
Wind shear and turbulence may be experienced in the lee of Mt. Errigal.
Caution wind shear and turbulence may be experienced on APP to RWY 20 in winds in the range of 260° - 310°.

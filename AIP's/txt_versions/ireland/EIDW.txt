EIDW AD 2.20 LOCAL TRAFFIC REGULATIONS
1. Ground Movement
1.1 General
i. Stop-bars are provided at all runway entry/exit points and ar e illuminated to protect active runways. When a 
runway is inactive the associated stop-bar is normally not illuminated. However, specific clearance from ATC 
must still be obtained before entering or crossing an inactive runway. 
ii. Pilots should use the minimum power necessary while taxiing.  In apron areas, pilots should operate at the 
minimum power commensurate with the intended manoeuvre, due to the effect of jet blast on personnel, 
equipment and buildings.
iii. Flight crew are responsible for wing tip clearance and are reminded of the importance of maintaining a careful 
lookout at all times, regardless of location and visibility conditions.
iv.  ATC may require aircraft to manoeuvre in close proximity to  other aircraft. Avoidance of other aircraft is the 
responsibility of the flight crew involved. If doubt exists as to whether an aircraft can be passed safely, the 
flight crew should stop, advise ATC, and request alternative instructions if available.
v. In order to assist in the safe separation of aircraft, when f light crew are instructed to stop at any runway-
holding or intermediate holding position they should position the aircraft as close as possible to the relevant 
pavement marking while ensuring that the marking remains visible from the cockpit.
1.2 Turning
No turns should be made by aircraft at taxiway/taxiway intersections where taxi centreline markings are not 
provided. Particular attention is drawn to the following:
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from RWY 28R to TWY N3 o r vice versa. 
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from RWY 28R to TWY N4 o r vice versa.
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from RWY 28R to RWY 16 o r vice versa.
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from RWY 10L to TWY N5 o r vice versa.
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from RWY 10L to RWY 16 o r vice versa.
  • No left turns should be made by aircraft from TWY M to RWY 3 4 or vice versa.
  • No left turns should be made by aircraft from TWY E2 to TWY F-OUTER.
  • No right turns should be made by aircraft from TWY F-OUTER n orth of Link 6 to TWY E2. 
No turns should be made at taxiway/taxiway intersections where taxi centreline markings are not provided.
Particular attention is drawn to the following:
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from TWY W1 to TWY S Eas t of TWY W1 or vice versa.
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from TWY F1 to TWY B2 or  vice versa.
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from TWY B2 to TWY E1 or  vice versa.
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from TWY A to TWY F1 or vice versa.
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from TWY W1 to TWY W2 or  vice versa at intersection with TWY S.
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from TWY M to TWY N5.
  • No turns should be made by aircraft from TWY N to TWY N3.

on the adjacent parallel taxiways must give way to aircraft vacating the runway.
1.8 Runway 10R Operations
Unless otherwise instructed by ATC, aircraft vacating the runway must not stop on any of the following taxiways: S2, 
S3 and S4. ATC may instruct arrivals to stop on taxiways E1 or S1 on a tactical basis. Aircraft vacating the runway 
and stopping on any of these taxiways are not clear of the runway. Aircraft on the adjacent parallel taxiways must 
give way to aircraft vacating the runway.
1.9 Runway 28R Operations
Unless otherwise instructed by ATC, aircraft vacating the runway must not stop on any of the following taxiways: N5, 
N6 and N7. Aircraft vacating the runway and stopping on any of these taxiways are not clear of the runway. Aircraft 
exiting these taxiways must continue on to the section of TWY M parallel to the runway to clear the runway. Aircraft 
on the adjacent parallel taxiways must give way to aircraft vacating the runway.
1.10 Runway 10L Operations
Unless otherwise instructed by ATC, aircraft vacating the runway must not stop on any of the following taxiways: N4, 
N3, N2 and N1. Aircraft vacating the runway and stopping on any of these taxiways are not clear of the runway. 
Aircraft exiting these taxiways must continue on to the section of TWY N parallel to the runway to clear the runway. 
Aircraft on the adjacent parallel taxiways must give way to aircraft vacating the runway.
2. Availability of Intersection Take-Off
Take-offs using less than the full length of the runway are available (except during Low Visibility Operations) from 
TWY/RWY intersections as listed in EIDW AD 2.13 
During Low Visibility Operations, intersection take-offs using less than the full length are NOT permitted from 
RWY10R/28L.
The datum from which the reduced declared distances on RWY10R/28L, RWY 10L/28R and RWY16 are measured 
is the downwind edge of the specific taxiway projected perpendicular to the runway centreline as per section III-3 of 
the European Air Navigation Plan
The datum from which the reduced declared distances on RWY34 are measured is the intersection of the extended 
downwind edge of Taxiway S with the runway edge projected perpendicular to the runway centreline.
The take-off run available (TORA) is displayed on an illuminated sign adjacent to the taxiway.

2.1 RWY10R/28L and RWY 16/34
Intersection take-offs are subject at all times to pilots' discretion and aircraft operational requirements. Pilots should 
advise as early as possible of their ability to accept intersection take-offs.
Approval for intersection take-offs is subject to the air traffic situation.
2.2 RWY 10L/28R
Intersection take-offs from N2 and N6 are considered the primary line up points for RWY28R and RWY10L 
respectively in normal operations and also in Low Visibility Operations. Taxiways N1 and N7 are NOT available for 
departure in LVOs. Pilots should advise as early as possible if unable to accept departure from these points. Further 
information refer to 3.3 HIRO Departures.
Intersection take-offs are not available during Low Visibility Operations.
3 High Intensity Runway Operations (HIRO)
High Intensity Runway Operations (HIRO) are valid from 0600 to 2400HR (local time) unless otherwise advised by 
ATC (e.g. via ATIS). The HIRO system optimises separation of aircraft on final approach in order to minimise runway 
occupancy time for both arriving and departing aircraft, thereby maximising runway utilisation and minimising “go-
around”.
3.1 Arrivals
Pilots are reminded that by leaving the runway at the fastest speed commensurate with safety and standard 
operating procedures, ATC will be able to guide aircraft on final approach using minimum radar separation or 
separation minimum according to wake vortex category. Extended runway occupancy may result in a missed 
approach.
In order to reduce runway occupancy times, pilots shall apply the following procedure: 
Pilots should pre-plan their landing and roll out to target the appropriate exit taxiway, weather permitting, that 
provides for a safe and expeditious exit from the runway to reduce delays and maximise utilisation at all times
Pilots are to ensure runway fully vacated before stopping i.e. aircraft are not to stop on any runway exit awaiting 
instructions from ATC but should continue on to the next available taxiway (unless instructed to do so by ATC)
Tactical requests to extend the landing roll to reduce ground taxi/exit nearer to parking stands are not to be made 
to ATC
Aircraft unable to vacate the runway via the preferred taxiways should notify ATC when the aircraft is between 8 and 
4 NM from touchdown, or at the earliest opportunity after which it has been determined that it is unable to comply.
The preferred exit taxiways for RWY10R and RWY28L are:
Pilots may plan their arrival using the threshold-to-exit-point distances set out in the table above. The distances are 
measured from the landing threshold to the point of the intersection of the runway centreline and the extended exit 
taxiway centreline pavement marking.

If the pilot of a landing aircraft cannot contact ATC due to RTF congestion, the pilot should fully vacate the runway 
and taxi into the next available taxiway. The pilot should then hold position until contact with ATC can be established.
3.2 Departures
ATC will consider every aircraft at the runway holding position as able to commence line-up and take-off roll 
immediately after clearance is issued, unless otherwise instructed. Pilots not ready when reaching the holding point 
(no aircraft in front on the same taxiway) shall advise ATC on Tower frequency as early as possible before entering 
the RWY. When cleared for take-off, ATC will expect and has planned on seeing movement within 10 seconds (of 
take-off clearance being issued). Wake vortex separation is applied by ATC in accordance with the published 
requirements. If more separation than the prescribed minima is requested, pilots shall notify ATC before entering 
the RWY.
Where possible, cockpit checks and cabin readiness should be completed before line-up and any checks needing 
completion on the runway should be kept to the minimum required. Pilots should not back-track when entering the 
runway unless specifically requested at the runway holding position.
Note: Pilots shall not cross the runway-holding position until the illuminated red stop bar has been extinguished. 
ATC do not issue conditional line-up clearances where stop bars are operational at line-up points.
3.3 Preferred Use of Intersection Take-Offs
Based on aircraft type and performance characteristics, ATC may issue instructions for aircraft to depart from 
runway intersections from which adequate take-off run is available. Intersection take-offs are subject at all times to 
pilots' discretion and aircraft operational requirements. Pilots unable to accept departure from an intersection point 
may request an alternate take-off position from ATC. Pilots requiring departure from the beginning of the runway 
should request it at the time of push-back/start-up, and such requests will be considered by ATC subject to delay.
The preferred use of intersection take-offs are set out in the table below.
3.4 Additional information on runway usage is available EIDW AD 2.21 NOISE ABATEMENT PROCEDURES Section 5
4. Mandatory ground handling of aircraft at Dublin Airport  
All aircraft must avail of ground handling. All aircraft of less than 2 tonnes maximum certified AUW must avail of

ii. Red mandatory signs;
iii. Red controllable stopbar lights;
iv. Yellow flashing runway guard lights (Configuration A);
v. Location signs - yellow on a black background;
9.5 Runway-holding positions cannot be passed without permission  from ATC.
9.6 Aircrews are advised that should they become unsure of their  position while taxiing, they should contact ATC 
immediately and request assistance.
9.7 Due to the close proximity of the two runways Runway 28L and  Runway 34, aircrews taking off from Runway 28L 
or Runway 34 are advised to ensure that they are lined up on the correct runway before commencing take-off run.
10 Stop bars 
Pilots shall not cross illuminated stop bars. A pilot receiving instructions which imply that an illuminated stop bar 
should be crossed shall wait until the stop bar is extinguished. If the stop bar remains illuminated, the pilot shall 
request confirmation from ATC that the stop bar is to be crossed. Instructions to cross illuminated stop bars will only 
be given in exceptional circumstances. 
In the event of failure of the stop bar control mechanism, the following line up points shall be used:
The following phraseology shall be used by ATC to instruct pilots or vehicle drivers to cross an illuminated stop bar:
ATC: “[Callsign] Due to a failure of the control system, the stop bar will remain illuminated. Taxi/proceed across the 
stop bar on taxiway [designator] / runway [designator] Echo 1/Sierra 7/November 4 and line up RWY [designator]

11 Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM)
11.1 Flight Plan Validation
Three hours prior to the Estimated Off-Block Time (EOBT) of a flight, checks will be performed to verify the 
consistency between the ATC Flight Plan, Airport Slot and Airport Flight Data.
If the Scheduled Off-Block Time (SOBT) deviates from the EOBT, the relevant contact person will be informed and 
advised to adjust the times accordingly. Aircraft Operator (AO) or their Handling Agent (HA) is responsible for timely 
update of aircraft registration in the A-CDM portal (AOS).
11.2 Target Off-Block Time (TOBT)
This is the time that an Aircraft Operator or their Handling Agent estimates that an aircraft will be ready, all doors 
closed, boarding bridge removed, push back vehicle available, de-icing completed, and ready to start up/push back 
immediately upon reception of clearance from the Tower. 
TOBT= Prediction of “Aircraft Ready”
11.3 Automated TOBT
120 minutes prior to the Estimated Off-Block Time (EOBT), the A-CDM portal (AOS) system will automatically 
generate a default Target Off-Block Time (TOBT).
11.4 Person Responsible for TOBT
The Aircraft Operator or their agent is responsible for entry, update and if necessary deletion of TOBT’s. It is the 
responsibility of the AO/HA to communicate and ensure the pilot of a flight has the correct TOBT prior to calling for 
clearance. TSAT will also be included in DCL messages. If it becomes obvious that the TOBT cannot be respected, 
it shall be corrected or re-entered by the person responsible for the TOBT. Since the TOBT is used for various 
ground processes, it shall be updated by the person responsible for the TOBT when deviations of more than 
5minutes occur. 
For deviations of 15minutes or more from the EOBT, it will still be mandatory to send a delay message (DLA) to the 
Network Manager.
11.5 TOBT Update/Deletion
Until the TSAT has been issued (TOBT minus 40 minutes) the TOBT can be updated as often as desired. After the 
TSAT has been issued, the TOBT can be updated up to three times. If a sixth TOBT update is required the flights 
TSAT will be removed and the flight will get re-sequenced. It is important to recognise that once sequenced, changes 
to TOBT are likely to impact the aircraft’s position in the Pre-Departure Sequence (PDS). TOBTs require updating 
if they differ by 5mins from the previous declared TOBT. 
If a flight is to be taken out of the TOBT/TSAT calculation, the TOBT shall be deleted. The TOBT shall be re-entered 
by the person responsible for the TOBT.
11.6 TOBT Reporting Routines
The TOBT is viewed and or adjusted in one of the following ways:
  • A-CDM Portal (AOS)
  • AOS Mobile Application
  • Internal system of the Airline/Handling Agent (via interface )
  • By telephone via the Dublin A irport Control Centre (ACC), Phone + 353 (0) 1 814 4352
  • Advanced Visual Docking Guidance System (A-VDGS) (specific s tands)

11.7 Target Start-up Approval Time (TSAT)
The TSAT is the target time for start-up approval according to the Dublin A-CDM Operational procedures, taking into 
account TOBT, Calculated Take Off Time (CTOT), and/or the traffic situation. The earliest time for the TSAT 
calculation (by the PDS) is 40 minutes prior to TOBT. 
TOBT is the time at which an Aircraft Operator, or his duly accredited representative expect the flight will be ready 
to commence movement; whereas the TSAT is the time at which Ground will grant the start-up. 
It is the responsibility of the AO/HA to communicate the most up to date TSAT to the pilot, prior to doors closing. 
The “Pre-Departure Sequence” is a result of the calculated TSATs.
11.8 TSAT Reporting Routines
The TSAT is transmitted in one of the following ways, via:
  • A-CDM Portal (AOS)
  • AOS Mobile application
  • Internal system of the airline/Handling agent (via interface )
  • Datalink Clearance (DCL). If a TSAT changes post clearance, ATC will communicate the revised TSAT 
verbally to the pilot. A revised DCL message will not be issued, post ATC clearance.
  • Advanced Visual Docking Guidance System (A-VDGS) (specific s tands)
 
11.9 Start-up and Push-back
The sequence of push and start is based on the TSAT sequence. The following rules apply:
  • The Pilot shall report ready to push and start at TOBT (+/-)  5 minutes. (ATC clearance (including DCL) shall 
be requested any time prior to TOBT from delivery)
  • The aircraft has to be ready for start-up at TOBT
  • Ground will issue push and start approval at TSAT (+/-) 5 mi nutes
  • If pilots have received their ATC clearance and called at TO BT and Ground has not called to give push and 
start approval by TSAT + 5minutes, pilots are requested to call Ground requesting push and start approval.
In case of delays (>5 minutes) after ATC clearance has been received and/or a call ready at TOBT has been made, 
pilot shall inform clearance of the delay and a new TOBT must be sent by the AO/HA.
11.10 Datalink Clearances (DCL)
For datalink departure clearance (DCL), the published procedures and the time parameters published in the AIP will 
remain valid. The TSAT will also be transmitted in DCL messages.
11.11 De-icing
De-icing must be completed before an aircraft can report ready for push and start. De-icing times shall be taken into 
account, to calculate the TOBT.
11.12 Coordination with the Network Manager (NMOC)
A permanent and fully automatic data exchange with the Network Operations will be established. This data transfer 
will enable highly accurate early predictions of landing and departure times. Furthermore, this will allow for more 
accurate and efficient calculation of the CTOT (when applicable) due to the use of local target take-off times. The 
following messages are used:

  • Flight Update Message (FUM)
  • Early Departure Planning Information Message (E-DPI)
  • Target Departure Planning Information Message (T-DPI)
  • ATC Departure Planning Information Message (A-DPI)
The basic Network Operations procedures continue to apply. The Network operations will generally take those local 
Target Take -Off Times (TTOT) into consideration, when updating the flights’ profiles in its system. In some cases 
Clearance Delivery position will offer to coordinate a new CTOT (if applicable) in agreement with the pilot.
11.13 Remote Holding
In the event of a contact stand not being available, Dublin Airport will request a remote hold stand position from ATC. 
The Pre-departure Sequencer (PDS) will recalculate the variable taxi time from this new remote hold location.
11.14 Contact and Information
For the TOBT dialogue and the TSAT submission, all Aircraft Operators/Handling Agents have to appoint a person 
responsible for TOBT and give the details to the airport company.
VFR flights are not part of the A-CDM process and therefore do not require TOBTs to be entered.

3.2 Cat C, D Aircraft
3.2.1 Departures from all runwa ys except Runway 10R, must track the runway extended centreline after take-off until 
passing 750ft and then proceed in accordance with the relevant Instrument Flight Procedure published departure 
track and adhere to published altitude/level restrictions unless otherwise cleared by ATC.
3.2.2 Departures from Runway 10R must track the runway extended centreline to 5NM before commencing turn to the 
north, or to 6NM before commencing turn to the south.
3.2.3 Take-off climb shall comply with the procedure detailed be low, which is based on noise abatement departure climb 
guidance contained in PANS OPS Doc 8168 Vol 1 - Appendix to Chapter 3 - NADP2.
3.2.4 Take-off thrust, speed V² + 20 to 40 km/h (V² + 10 to 20kt ).
3.2.4.1 At 240m (800ft) and while maintaining a positive rate of  climb, body angle is reduced and flaps/slats are retracted 
on schedule as the aircraft is accelerated towards Vzf.
3.2.4.2 Power/thrust is reduced during the flap/slat retraction sequence at a point that ensures satisfactory acceleration 
performance.
3.2.4.3 (3000ft) Transition smoothly to en-route climb speed. 
3.2.4.4 Cat C and D aircraft operating from Runway 28L directly to Weston or Baldonnel aerodromes are exempt from 
Sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. These aircraft must not leave the environmental corridor below 1,500ft QNH. 
4. Jet aircraft (Cat C/D) on visual approach to all runways must  join final approach no closer than 6NM from touchdown. 
Aircraft must follow a descent path which will not result in being at any time lower than the approach path which 
would otherwise be followed using the ILS glide-path.
5. Runway 10L/R or 28L/R are the required Runways between 0600 a nd 2300HR Local Time when the crosswind 
component is 20KT or less. Runway 28L/R will be the preferential Runways when the tailwind component is 10KT 
or less and braking action is assessed as good. Aircraft will be required to use these Runways except when 
operational reasons dictate otherwise. 
If the crosswind component on Runway 10L/R or Runway 28L/R is greater than 20KT Runway 16 or Runway 34 
may become the active Runway. If the forecast crosswind component on Runway 10L/R or 28L/R is greater than 
20KT Runway 16 or 34 may become the active Runway. 
The use of Runway 16/34 will be kept to an absolute minimum subject to operational conditions.
6. Runways will be prioritised for noise abatement purposes betw een 2300 and 0600HR Local Time, subject to the 
same wind calculation method and values as used between 0600 and 2300HR Local time (see Section 5).
7. Reverse thrust should not be used during landing operations o n any runway between 2300-0600HR Local Time, 
except where operational or safety reasons dictate otherwise.
8. Cat C and D aircraft using Runways 28L, 28R, 10L,16 and 34 sh all operate within environmental corridors which are

5. Arrival Procedures
5.1 Clearance to enter the CTA and CTR
Aircraft flying the ATS Route system will be cleared into the CTA/CTR without having to request a specific entry 
clearance.
Arriving Aircraft will normally be cleared on a STAR appropriate to the route by ATC. On occasions ATC may radar 
vector aircraft for arrival (Due traffic or technical reasons).
5.2 Initial Approach Procedures
5.2.1 With radar control
In order to expedite the flow of traffic, aircraft may receive radar vectors on to final approach from the STAR.
For RWYs 16 & 34 pilots should plan their flight profile in such a manner as to be able to achieve 6000ft QNH at the 
appropriate hold. 
For RWY 28L/R & 10L/R pilots should plan their flight profile on the sequencing leg to achieve level constraints. 
ACTUAL DESCENT CLEARANCE WILL BE AS DIRECTED BY ATC.
5.2.2 Without radar control
When arriving traffic cannot be sequenced by radar, aircraft will be cleared to join the Instrument Approach 
Procedure appropriate to the landing from the hold.
5.3 Communications failure procedures for arriving aircraft
5.3.1 RWY16 & 34
Aircraft experiencing communications failure in the Dublin CTA/CTR shall set transponder code A7600 and comply

6. Departure Procedures
6.1 Departure Clearance Service using Datalink (DCL)
6.1.1 Introduction
6.1.1.1 The DCL service uses the Aircraft Communications Address ing and Reporting System (ACARS). 
DCL messages are described in EUROCAE ED-85A Appendix A and ARINC 623-2.
6.1.1.2 DCL departure clearances are provided solely to those fl ights departing Dublin Airport.
6.1.1.3 Clearance Delivery Procedures via RT (voice) will be uti lised in the event of datalink transaction failure.
6.1.1.4 Oceanic traffic can receive domestic clearances via ACAR S.
6.1.2 Datalink procedure
6.1.2.1 The pilot will send a departure clearance request utilis ing the on-board datalink interface. Minimum 15 minutes 
before start-up. Any slot times will be taken into account by the pilot in the request if appropriate.
6.1.2.2 If the clearance is not received by the pilot within 3 m inutes of the request the pilot will contact ATC through the 
normal RT communication channels and obtain a clearance on RT.
6.1.2.3 Where the pilot receives a Datalink reply and cannot acc ept the clearance he will contact ATC through the normal 
RT channels to obtain, an alternate clearance on RT.
6.1.2.4 If the pilot is satisfied with the Datalink clearance an  acknowledgement message will be sent to the ground system.
6.1.2.4.1 If the ground system does not receive the acknowledgement message within 3 minutes after the clearance has been 
transmitted, or if an invalid message is received, ATC will contact the pilot through the normal VHF channels and 
issue the clearance via RT (voice).
6.1.2.5 All departure clearances issued through the normal VHF R T voice channels will cancel the DCL service.
6.2 RWY 28L, 28R, 10L, 10R, 16 and 34 Departures
6.2.1 Standard Instrument Departures (SID)
Aircraft on IFR flights departing from RWY 28L, 28R, 10L, 10R, 16 and 34 will proceed in accordance with Standard 
Instrument Departures (SID) WHICH ALSO INCLUDE MANDATORY NOISE ABATEMENT ELEMENTS for jet 
aircraft. 
Category C and D departures shall remain on DUBLIN TOWER frequency until passing 2,000ft, then contact 
DUBLIN ACC Lower North/DUBLIN ACC Lower South as appropriate.
Where ICAO obstacle clearance criteria require minimum climb gradient greater than 3.3% the required values will 
be included in the SID.
As a cross check to confirm the correct SID has been selected in the FMS, Category C and D departures will be 
requested by CDS to confirm the first waypoint on the SID e.g. RWY 10R “DW553”.

6.2.2 OMNI Directional Departures
Aircraft subject to an OMNI Directional Departures instruction from RWY 28L, 28R, 10L, 10R, 16 and 34 climb 
straight ahead to 3000ft, and then depart on track as cleared by ATC, maintain a minimum climb gradient of 6.6% 
for ATM (400ft/NM) (4% for obstacle clearance). Remain on DUBLIN TOWER frequency until passing 2,000ft, then 
contact DUBLIN ACC lower North/DUBLIN ACC Lower South as appropriate. 
CAUTION: Close-in-obstacles (Mast, Poles, Fence, Trees, Equipment) exist. 
6.3 Communications failure procedures for departing aircraft
Aircraft experiencing communications failure in the Dublin CTA/CTR shall set transponder code A7600 and comply 
with standard ICAO procedures,
Supplemented by the following:
i. For aircraft departing on a SID where no cruising level has b een specified in the enroute clearance (and 
therefore no level specified in the Current Flight Plan) the climb, after the appropriate time interval, shall be 
to the level contained in the Filed Flight Plan.
ii. Aircraft routeing on a ROTEV SID expecting transition to BOY NE 
Aircraft routeing on a ROTEV SID experiencing communications failure, and expecting transition to BOYNE, 
should continue to ROTEV, then, in the most expeditious manner, route to BOYNE to join the Current Flight 
Plan route. Maintain the last assigned level for a period of three minutes, and then climb to the level specified 
in the Current Flight Plan. 
7. Low Visibility Procedures
7.1. Low Visibility Procedures
Low Visibility Procedures means procedures applied at an Aerodrome for the purpose of ensuring safe operations 
during lower than Standard Category I, other than Standard Category II, Category II and III approaches and low 
visibility take-offs. Low Visibility take-off (LVTO) means a take-off with a runway visual range (RVR) lower than 400m 
but not less than 75m.
When Low Visibility Procedures are in force the following standard taxi route system applies:

(118.500 MHz) is allocated to the provision of FIS for aircraft in class G airspace.
10.3.1 Low Flying Aircraft Radio Communications
When flying at low level, in or around mountainous terrain or in other regions with poor radio communication, radio 
transmissions to and from ground might not be possible due to obstacles affecting line of sight VHF radio 
communications.
Aircraft at low level ˂1500ft (where the radio horizon is roughly 55 miles/90km) and below may have difficulties 
establishing and/or maintaining radio communication with Dublin FIS radios located at Dublin Airport in the area 
south of the Wicklow mountains or at the boundaries of the Dublin CTA due to radio horizon and radio line of sight 
due to terrain obstacles, coupled with the aircraft antennas fitted.
Aircraft should consider problems with establishing and/or maintaining radio communication with Dublin FIS.
10.4 Landing Lights should be shown at all times during flight w ithin Dublin CTR.

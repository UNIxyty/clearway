Update to Aerodrome/Heliport Chart and Aircraft Parking/Docking Chart for Terrance B. 
Lettsome International Airport (TUPJ)
Effective: 251014 to PERM
The following information have been updated for the Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport (TUPJ):
• Taxiway Contingency
Iden
tified hotspots in the area of RWY 07 threshold, pose an increased risk of runway incursions.
Insufficient visual range of Taxiway Alpha  and Taxiway Bravo from the Control Tower due to
obs
tacle, increases  the  safety  risk  to  aircraft.
All 
 pilots  will  be  required  to  report  once  vacated  of  the  active runway, when using Taxiway
Alpha o
r Taxiway Bravo.
Fur
ther instructions will be given to each aircraft by the Control Tower.
• Update
 to the Aerodrome/Heliport Chart – ICAO, to include corrected RWY 07/25 THR
coordinates 
and THR elevations, as well as hot spots located at TWY A and TWY B.
Please
 see Attachment A for updated chart.

34. PIARCO FIR (TTZP)
  SUGGESTED ROUTINGS TO BE UTILIZED WITHIN THE PIARCO FIR DUE TO THE  REMOVAL OF 
  THE  UA550, UA551 AND UA561  ROUTES
Effective: 250917 to 260930
  The reorganization of the Piarco Flight Information Region is being implemented in a phased
 approach.
    Currently, based on collaboration with all stakeholders, the upper airspace has been redesigned
 taking into account the Performance Based Navigation (PBN) concept. In addition, through the
    CANSO/IATA/ICAO Free Route Airspace (CIIFRA) initiative, a number of pre-approved optimized
 routes have been implemented.
 The next phase of the airspace optimization project involves the connection of the new/revised
 upper airspace routes to the lower airspace arrival and departure routes into the aerodromes
 within the Piarco FIR. The implementation of this phase is expected to take place over 2026/2027. 
    Aircraft Operators and Flight Dispatchers are urged to please take note of the following:
  - RNAV 5 routes implemented in the  Piarco FIR which have been incorporated into the Eastern 
 Caribbean AIP (ENR 3.2):
• UP533
•
UN669
•
UP410
•
UM662
  - Conventional routes which have been removed from the Piarco FIR:
•
UA550
•
UA551
•
UA561
 With regards to flights that previously utilized the UA550, UA551 and UA561 between the Piarco
 and Maiquetia FIRs, the following are suggested routings to be filed in the interim until the full
    implementation of the Piarco FIR Airspace Optimization is completed:

SEARCH	AND	RESCUE	SERVICES
The	Search	and	Rescue	Services	at	Robert	L.	Bradshaw	International	Airport,	have	been	updated	as				
follows:
The	St.	Kitts	and	Nevis	Defence	Force	Coast	Guard	(SKNDF-CG)	is	responsible	for	providing	Search	
and Rescue	(SAR)	services	to	vessels	in	distress	within	the	territorial	waters	of	St.	Kitts	and	Nevis.				
Additionally,	we	offer	SAR	assistance	in	neighbouring	or	international	waters	upon	request	from				
neighbouring	islands.	At	present,	the	SKNDF-CG	operates	solely	with	sea-going	maritime	assets.				
However,	the	Maritime	Coordination	Centre	(MRCC)	Fort	De	France,	which	oversees	the	Search	and					
Rescue	Region	(SRR)	that	includes	St.	Kitts,	provides	aerial	support	as	needed.	This	aerial	assistance	
is typically	rendered	by	either	the	French	or	Dutch	Caribbean	Coast	Guard,	based	on	the	specific				
requirements	of	the	situation.	The	Coast	Guard	Base	maintains	vigilance	by	monitoring	marine	VHF				
frequencies	ranging	from	121.500MHz	to	156.000MHz	and	extending	up	to	162.500MHz.	In	addition	
to these	capabilities,	the	SKNDF-CG	coordinates	with	local	salvage	and	towing	companies	for	
operational support.	For	salvage	operations,	we	collaborate	with	St.	Kitts	Marine	Works	Ltd,	and	for	
towing operations,	we	enlist	the	services	of	Marine	Assist	when	the	tow	limit	of	our	assets	are	
surpassed.	This comprehensive	approach	ensures	effective	management	of	maritime	emergencies	
and	coordination with	both	national	and	regional	resources.

1.2.6  The following are the ATC procedures for the conduct of: NDB (DME) and RNAV/GNSS approaches 
at Douglas Charles. 
a)  NDB (DME) Approaches 
Pilots of IFR aircraft landing at Douglas Charles, Dominica, will be cleared by Le Raizet APP or 
Fort de France APP to proceed to IAF NOSAM in order to conduct an NDB RWY27 approach 
procedure. Pilots may request to proceed to IAF SEDOG or ULOMA either prior to reaching FOF 
or PPR or before departing TFFF or TFFR. 
b) RNAV/GNSS Approaches 
Pilots of IFR aircraft landing at Douglas Charles, Dominca, who intend to conduct an RNAV/GNSS 
RWY 27 procedure, shall advise Le Raizet APP or Fort de France APP either prior to reaching FOF 
or PPR or before departing TFFF or TFFR. The pilot shall inform Le Raizet APP or Fort de France 
APP of the appropriate IAF (ADVUR, VOLAB or IGROP) to which they request to be cleared. Le 
Raizet APP will provide clearance for the aircraft to conduct said approach procedure.  
 
1.2.7  In the event of failure of the NDB or DME at Douglas Charles; for IFR aircraft that are not able 
to conduct the RNAV (GNSS) RWY 27 Approach, Le Raizet RAPCO will provide an ATC clearance 
to fly NOSAM (the defaul t IAF), either by the aircraft’s own navigation or by providing Radar -

visual approach or the pilot may cancel IFR flight and continue VFR.

20. Local Aerodrome Regulations
1. Parking
1.1 TWR will allocate aircraft stand. For aircraft operating within the service 
hours of ADO request for marshaller assistance shall be submitted to TWR. 
For aircraft with planned operation outside the service hours of ADO, the 
request shall be submitted together with the application for use of the Air Base.
Due to Security regulations, General Aviation pilots and passengers are not 
allowed to leave the aircraft, unless a Marshall is present or other information is 
given from Airport Office (ARO). Therefore all aircraft must contact the Airport 
Office (ARO) on frequency 131.550 for Marshall assistance. As Marshall can be 
occupied elsewhere, some waiting time can be expected.
2. RWY 03/21 and RWY 14/32
2.1 The runways are available for take-off and landing during daytime only.
21. Noise Abatement Procedures
Noise abatement procedures for all jet aircraft and for propeller and turboprop 
aircraft MTOW above 5700 KG for departure or missed approach RWY 09L 
and 09R:
IMC: Turn must not be commenced before DME KAR (CH 37x) 6.5 NM 
(or DME KAP (CH 20y) 4.0 NM) or 2000 FT AMSL, whichever comes first.
VMC: Avoid overflying the towns/villages Karup and Kølvrå below 2000 FT 
MSL.
22. Flight Procedures
1. IFR Arrival
1.1 Aircraft will normally be cleared by ACC KØBENHAVN to REVBO, RIKSU 
or TACAN KAR. Aircraft with a destination other than Karup inside LTA 
KARUP will be cleared direct destination.
1.2 Radio communication failure
Navigation aid designated for radio communication failure during IMC for arriv-
ing aircraft is:
- MORHA when RWY 09R is expected runway in use
- VOCAT when RWY 27L is expected runway in use
1.3 Use of ILS for approach in VMC
When ILS is intended used for approach in VMC, ATC must be advised at 
least 5 minutes before beginning the approach, as the critical areas in front of 
the ILS facilities normally may be expected only to be kept free of disturbing 
objects in IMC.
1.4 Precision Approach. Category II Operations
The operations are subject to the following procedures and conditions:
a. ATC procedures
The minimum distance between an aircraft on final approach carrying out 
a Category II ILS approach and any other preceding aircraft will not be 
less than 10 NM. The separation must be established at the latest when 
preceding aircraft passes THR.
Departing aircraft must have commenced take-off run before arriving air-
craft has left 2000 FT on final approach.
Taxiing aircraft can expect to be instructed to hold at CATII holding posi-
tions E or S for RWY 27L.
b. Pilot procedures.
Pilots who intend to carry out a Category II ILS approach are to use the 
following phrase: "Request Category II ILS approach runway 27 Left".
2. IFR Departure
2.1 Standard Instrument Departures
Standard Instrument Departures (SID) have not been established.
2.2 Omnidirectional departure
Climb straight ahead to at least 850 FT MSL before turn is commenced. If 
departing from RWY 09R/L, see para. 21 (Noise abatement procedures).
3. Reduced Visibility Operations
3.1 ATC will apply special safeguards and procedures for movement on the 
maneuvering area during conditions of reduced visibility
3.2 Criteria for activation of Reduced Visibility Operation Procedures
ATC will activate Reduced Visibility Operation Procedures if the reported visi-
bility is 3000 M or less or if parts of the maneuvering area not visually observ-
able from the tower cabin. Activation will not be reported to aircraft.
3.3 The following procedures will apply during conditions of reduced visibility
ATC will limit movement of vehicles and aircraft to only one on each taxiway 
segment and/or RWY unless
- ATC can visually observe involved aircraft/vehicles
- Per request from ATC, that the trailing aircraft/vehicle reports that it has 
the preceding aircraft in sight, until such time that they have passed each other 
and/or are no longer present on the same runway/taxiway segment. Pilots 
shall report if visual contact is inadvertently lost.
- Pilots will be instructed to report clear of runways or the maneuvering 
area.
4. Low Visibility Operations (LVO)
4.1 ATC will apply special safeguards and procedures during conditions of 
low visibility.
4.2 Criteria for activation of LVO procedures
Low Visibility Operation Procedures are activated by ATC and will normally be 
introduced at RVR less than 800 M and/or a cloud base of 300 FT, however no 
later than an RVR of 550 M or less and/or a cloud base of less than 200 FT.
4.3 Pilots will be informed when Low Visibility Operation Procedures are in 
operation by ATIS and/or RTF. Pilots will be informed over RTF when Low Vis-
ibility Operation Procedures are cancelled.
4.4 The following procedures will apply during Low Visibility Operation Proce-
dures:
a. ATC Procedures
When RVR is below 550 M ATC will allow only one aircraft on the maneu-
vering area. If marshalling is required the aircraft will be instructed to hold 
position until such time that the marshaller has either arrived at the aircraft 
or left the maneuvering area.
b. Pilot Procedures
Pilots shall on their own initiative report "runway vacated and established 
on…." when the entire aircraft has left the runway and is clear of the hold-
ing position for that runway.
5. Reduced Runway Separation
5.1  ATC will not apply reduced runway separation involving civilian flights.
6. VFR Flights
6.1 VFR reporting points, VFR holdings and VFR routes are established, see 
ANC 1:500 000.
7. Remarks: NIL.

20. Local Aerodrome Regulations
1. Parking
1.1 TWR will inform aircraft stand or parking area for arriving civil flights. 
Parking guidance by ground crew is compulsory for all stands and GA Parking. 
ACFT entering a stand must not proceed unless ground crew is present pro-
viding guidance for the AFCT.
Parking stand 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12 are marked with number, 
guidelines and stop lines.
Unless otherwise instructed by the marshaller, all A/C has to follow the taxiway 
marking (guidelines) on the apron.
Aircraft A330 series and larger will be parked with marshaller assistance.
General Aviation parking and other parking areas are not marked. Due to 
security regulations, General Aviation pilots and passengers are not allowed to 
leave the aircraft unless a marshaller is present. Therefore all aircraft parked 
at the General Aviation parking area and refuelling area, must contact the Air-
port Office (ARO) on frequency 131.555 for marshaller assistance. As mar-
shaller can be occupied elsewhere, some waiting time can be expected. 
Therefore contact the Airport Office (if possible) during approach.
All crew and airline staff (who are not flying as regular passengers, for exam-
ple technicians) needs to wear high visibility wests on the apron.
Refuelling is not permitted without advising the Airport Office.
2. Taxiing
2.1 Taxiing with ICAO code letter D and E shall take place via the route 
shown on the chart AD 2 - EKYT GMC.
3. Flight Plan
3.1 For all departing flights a complete flight plan or an abbreviated flight plan 
shall be submitted to the ATS reporting office at Aalborg before taxiing.
4. Exit from stand
In general:
To minimize blast on terminal, reduce power to idle after break away.
Call Aalborg TWR (118.305 MHz) for start up, ATC clearance and taxi instruc-
tions. Taxi instructions from Aalborg Tower does not overrule instructions 
given by the marshaller/Airport Office regarding movement on apron.
Aircraft requiring push-back requests push back directly to the push back truck 
when ready.
Unless otherwise instructed by the marshaller, all A/C have to follow the taxi-
way marking (guidelines) on the apron.
Push back is compulsory for departing A/C from stand 2-5 for aircraft type 
A319/320/321, B737-3/5/7/9 and MD80/90, if similar or larger A/C is parked on 
the stand to the right.
Exit from any stand by self-manoeuvring:
Pilots shall contact Airport Office (ARO) on frequency 131.555 at EOBT minus 
15 minutes.
No aircraft may exit any stand by self-manoeuvring unless an "all clear" signal 
(thumbs up) is given by ground crew or marshaller.
Stand 1-2:
Smaller Category C and all Category B aircraft (if parked at the E190, ATR, or 
CRJ marking) are allowed to leave the stand by self-manoeuvring with a right 
turn, regardless of aircraft parked in front of the North Flying hangar or on 
stand 1.
Stand 3-7:
Smaller category C and all category B Aircraft (when parked at the marking) 
are allowed to leave the stand by self-manoeuvring with a left or a right turn. 
The side to which the A/C turns has to be free from any other A/C.
Stand 8:
Smaller category C and all category B Aircraft (when parked at the marking) 
are allowed to leave the stand by self-manoeuvring with a right turn if stand 7 
is free from any other A/C.
Stand 10:
Stand 10 is vacated by self-manoeuvring with a left turn.
Stand 11:
Category C Aircraft (and lower) are allowed to leave the stand by self-
manoeuvring with a left turn onto TWY GA2.
Stand 12:
Category C Aircraft (and lower) are allowed to leave the stand by self-
manoeuvring with a left turn onto TWY GA2 if stand 11 is free from any other 
A/C. Otherwise push-back are mandatory. 
5. Use of auxiliary power unit (APU)
Use of APU on aircraft stands shall be limited as far as possible.
APU may be used:
• 5 minutes after on block.
• 5 minutes before leaving apron.
Exemptions:
When the outside air temperature (OAT) is below -10°C or above +25°C APU 
may be used as follows, unless otherwise instructed by marshaller:
•  5 minutes after on block.
•  15 minutes before leaving apron.
Engine start up for maintenance/test purpose on civil apron must be assigned 
by ATS reporting office (VHF 131.555 MHz). For all other locations contact
Aalborg TWR (VHF 118.305 MHz).
6. De-icing
De-icing and anti-icing
When ready for de-icing, request de-icing/anti-icing at Aalborg Airport Office/ 
Aalborg Handling frequency 131.555MHz. De-icing will take place on the 
stand. Aircraft will be pushed APRX 1 M before start of de-icing. Information 
about treatment and consumption of fluid to be obtained from the sprayer of 
the de-icing vehicle. De-icing will be done in the order de-icing is requested, 
however the sprayer of the de-icing vehicle may change the order in accord-
ance to the scheduled time of departure of the A/C. This in order to ensure as

smooth an operation as possible.
7. Non-Schengen flights
Aalborg Airport does not have H24 customs and immigrations, and therefore 
Aalborg Airport must be notified of all non-Schengen flights, either via the slot 
coordination (www.online-coordination.com) or via e-mail
(aalborg.airport@aal.dk). Detailed PAX list must be sent to:
njyl-graensekontrol@Politi.dk. If Aalborg Airport is not notified in due time (at 
least 3 hours prior arrival/departure) delays can be expected as immigrations 
has to be present prior to boarding and de-boarding of passengers and crew.
8. Removal of disabled aircraft from the runway
In case an aircraft is damaged on the runway, it is the duty and responsibility 
of the owner or user of the aircraft to ensure that it is removed as soon as pos-
sible. E.g. in case of punctures, it may be necessary that an aircraft - before 
replacement of wheels has taken place - moves away from the runway under 
its own power.
If a damaged aircraft is not removed from the runway as quickly as the Duty 
Airport Manager consider it necessary for reasonable dispatch of the traffic, he 
shall be entitled to have the aircraft removed for the account of the owner or 
user. Aalborg Airport is in some cases able to remove the aircraft free of 
charge (light aircraft only), but in such case, the owner or PIC has to sign a 
document stating that Aalborg Airport cannot be held responsible for any dam-
age applied to the aircraft during removal.

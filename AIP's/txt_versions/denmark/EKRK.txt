holding (TIDVU, ERNOV, KOR or FISKO) via routes listed below. Holdings are 
described in item 1.7.
Note: Traffic via AALBORG VOR/DME shall flightplan via T551-TNO to FISKO.
Traffic via RØNNE VOR shall flightplan via L983-ROBUS-DCT-KOR.
TIDVU holding and ERNOV holding are inside Swedish territory. Operators not 
permitted to overfly Swedish territory shall file outside Swedish territory.
1.3 Filing of flightplan
Traffic to København/Roskilde shall include appropriate primary holding in the 
flightplan.
1.4 Performance Restrictions/Level Restrictions
Descend from cruising level/top of descend shall be planned so as to meet the 
following level restrictions:
1.5 Radio communication failure during IFR approach.
In case of radio communication failure, the latest received and acknowledged 
level shall be maintained until the appropriate primary holding. In TIDVU hold-
ing decend to FL 70. In ERNOV holding decend to FL 100. In FISKO and KOR 
holding decend to 6000 FT MSL. If already at a lower altitude, maintain this. 
From the primary holding proceed to Roskilde holding. In Roskilde holding 
descend and perform the final approach procedure to the runway concerned.

1.7 Secondary Holdings for København/Roskilde
2. IFR Departure
2.1 IFR Departure, see AD 2 - EKRK IFR DEP .
3. Reduction of landing distance available
3.1 In order to increase the runway capacity, the Landing Distance Avail -
able can be reduced for arriving aircraft.
When the Landing Distance Available has been reduced for a landing aircraft 
on runway 03 this runway may simultaneously be crossed by departing, land-
ing or taxiing aircraft on runway 11/29 or by taxiing aircraft on taxiway Bravo.
When the Landing Distance Available has been reduced for a landing aircraft 
on runway 11 this runway may simultaneously be crossed by departing, land-
ing or taxiing aircraft on runway 03/21. 
Air Traffic Control will assess in which cases the procedures for reduction of 
Landing Distance Available can be applied. However, the Pilot-in-Command of 
the aircraft involved is responsible for determining whether the reduced Landing 
Distance Available in the actual situation is adequate for the aircraft in question.
The procedure for reduction of Landing Distance Available, will be used on the 
following conditions:
a) Landing Distance Available is reduced only during the daily period for 
VFR flights.
b) Landing Distance Available is reduced only when visual meteorological 
conditions (VMC) exists, and only when the pilots in command of the air-
craft involved are able to see the other aircraft
c) If RWY surface condition is reported as Dry (RWYCC 6).
d) Two-way radio communication must be established between Roskilde 
Tower and the aircraft involved on the same frequency.
e) The landing aircraft will in due time be asked whether the reduction of the 
Landing Distance Available is acceptable.
Following phraseology will be used:
For Runway 03: "CONFIRM ABLE TO ACCEPT A SHORT LANDING 
RUNWAY 03, SO AS TO STOP THE AIRCRAFT NOT LATER THAN TAXI-
WAY A 3. LANDING DISTANCE AVAILABLE 740 METRES".
For Runway 11: "CONFIRM ABLE TO ACCEPT A SHORT LANDING 
RUNWAY 11, SO AS TO STOP THE AIRCRAFT NOT LATER THAN TAXI-
WAY A. LANDING DISTANCE AVAILABLE 940 METRES".
f) Traffic information will be issued to both aircraft involved.
g) Involved aircraft must be in sight from Roskilde Tower from the time, where 
traffic information are issued and until landing.
h) Landing clearance will be issued with following phraseology:
For Runway 03: "STOP THE AIRCRAFT NOT LATER THAN TAXIWAY A 
3, RUNWAY 03 CLEARED TO LAND".
For Runway 11: "STOP THE AIRCRAFT NOT LATER THAN TAXIWAY A, 
RUNWAY 11 CLEARED TO LAND".
i) The condition as well as the clearance must be read back by the landing aircraft.
4. Reduced Runway Separation Minima
4.1 Reduced runway separation with reference to AIP AD 1.1 section 8.4, reduced 
runway separation minima are approved for aircraft classified as category 1.
The reduced runway separation, 600 meters between aircraft, must exist when a suc-
ceeding landing aircraft crossing the threshold or a succeeding departing aircraft com-
mencing take-off run. ATC will provide traffic information to succeeding aircraft when 
reduced runway separation is applied.
5. Low visibility procedures (LVP)
5.1 Low visibility take-off are established (LVTO).
Secondary power supply established below RVR 800 M, with a switch-over time of 
1 SEC. 
LVP are prompted by ATC and will be established no later than RVR 550 M and/or 
ceiling of 200 FT. 
Pilots will be informed when LVP are in operation by ATIS and RTF.
During LVP only one aircraft is allowed on the maneuvering area. ATC will ensure 
that no vehicle is allowed on the maneuvering area unless it is intended for assis-

No surface movement radar (SMR) available at EKRK. 
LVP is terminated when RVR is 600 M or above and ceiling 200 FT or above with 
an increasing trend, for a period of around 5 MIN.
ATC can delay termination based on an operational assessment of local weather.
Pilots will be informed over ATIS and RTF when LVP are cancelled.

6. VFR Flights
6.1 VFR reporting points have been established, see ANC 1:250 000 
COPENHAGEN AREA and ANC 1:500 000 DENMARK.
6.2 Description of the VFR-reporting points:
BORUP: Railway and road intersection.
ISHØJ: Crossroads,
KØGE: Highway intersection,
VALBY: Store Valby town
All reporting points are situated outside Roskilde CTR.
23. Additional Information
1. Limitation in ATIS:
1.1 To keep the length of the ATIS broadcast within the recommended 30 
seconds, flow restrictions will not be broadcast. The pilot-in-command must 
consult the Airport Briefing Office to obtain information about valid flow restric-
tions.
2. Gliding and hang gliding
2.1 Gliding and hang gliding within Copenhagen Area, see ANC 1:250 
000 Copenhagen Area.
2.2 VFR flights may obtain information about active gliding and hang 
gliding areas from ROSKILDE TOWER/APPROACH. A request for clearance 
to pass an active area will normally be complied with, but VFR flights cleared 
to pass an active area will not receive the prescribed traffic information and 
advice to avoid collision normally given by ATS for airspace class C. When fly-
ing in an active area the requirement for transponder - in airspace class C - is 
suspended.
2.3 IFR-flights will be separated from active gliding areas or from individ -
ual flights in mentioned areas.
Note: observe the fact, that gliding and hang gliding may take place below the 
lower limit of COPENHAGEN AREA, whether the areas are active or not.
2.4 Parachuting may take place
3. Flights in patterns or lanes (e.g.photoflights) with a duration of more 
than 15 minutes.
3.1 Do not expect permission to execute the flight inside EKCH CTR’s lat -
eral limitations below 4000FT.
3.2. Do not expect permission to execute the flight in the part of EKCH 
TMA and EKRK TMA with the lower limit at 1500FT in the following hours:
a) Monday to Friday 06 - 10 Danish time and 17 - 22 Danish time.
b) Sunday 17 - 22 Danish time.
3.3. Are expected to be executed at altitudes of 1000FT or FL, e.g. 
5000FT, 6000FT, FL 70 etc. within Copenhagen Area.
3.4. Might be repositioned or cancelled by WS-ATCC (Watch Supervisor 
Air Traffic Control Center) in coordination with ATC EKCH TWR, EKCH APP 
and EKRK TWR/APP, on the day for the flight due to the actual traffic situation.

20. Local Aerodrome Regulations
1. Taxiing and parking
1.1 TWR will inform ACFT stand or parking area for arriving flights.
1.2 ACFT will normally park without marshaller assistance following 
guidance from A-VDGS (Advanced Visual Docking Guidance System).
Parking stands 1 to 7 are marked with number, guidelines and stoplines, and 
are all equipped with A-VDGS.
Mandatory marshalling on all other parking stands and areas.
Unless otherwise instructed by marshaller, all ACFT are obligated to follow the 
taxi markings (guidelines) on the apron.
All crew and airline staff on duty, are required to wear high visibility vests on 
the apron.
1.3 Exit from stand
In general, all exit from stands are done by pushback.
If selv-maneuvering exits are agreed upon departure with "Aarhus Airport 
Office" on FREQ 131.555, this can only be performed with marshaller 
assistance.
ACFT report ready for departure and pushback to TWR on FREQ 118.530.
Approval for engine startup and/or pushback will be issued by the dispatcher 
or by the pushback driver.
Expect pushback facing upwind due to health issues for ground personnel.
To minimize blast on APRON, use minimum thrust during break away and taxi.
1.4 ACFT with MTOM below 5700 KG and a wing span not wider than 15 
M, shall normally park in the GENERAL AVIATION area.
Engine warm-up prior to departure for ACFT with MTOM below 5700 KG, will 
take place in the GENERAL AVIATION warm-up area on TWY G or at the 
holding point for RWY in use, as instructed by TWR.
1.5 On ACFT stands 1C, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, parking without marshaller 
assistance may take place following guidance from A-VDGS (Advanced Visual 
Docking Guidance System). Marshaller assistance is required for all ICAO 
type D and E ACFT.
On ACFT stands 15 and 16 no parking may take place without marshaller 
assistance.
Marshaller assistance is required when a stand is used by more than one 
ACFT at the same time.
Marshaller assistance is compulsory for all other stands and GA Parking.
1.6 All ACFT stands are equipped with a stand number and a yellow 
STOP marking, extending left from the yellow stand centre line.
On ACFT stands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, an A-VDGS is installed - giving ACFT 
azimuth and stopping guidance. If the docking guidance system on assigned 
stand is not displaying correct type of ACFT, pilot in command is required to 
stop the ACFT and contact "Aarhus Airport Office" on FREQ 131.555.
2. De-icing and anti-icing of aircraft
De-icing and anti-icing of aircraft may take place on all parking stands, and 
can be requested via "Aarhus Airport Office" on FREQ 131.555.
Information about treatment and consumption of fluid to be obtained from 
supervisor or from "Aarhus Airport Office" on FREQ 131.555.
3 School Flights
Prior permission required (PPR) for all school flights, TEL +45 87 75 70 50.
4. Flight Plan
For all departing flights a complete flight plan or an abbreviated flight plan shall 
be submitted to the ATS reporting office at Aarhus before taxiing.
5. Removal of disabled aircraft from runway
In case an aircraft is damaged on a runway, it is the duty of the owner or user 
of such aircraft to ensure that it is removed as soon as possible. E.g. in case of 
punctures, it may be necessary that an aircraft - before replacement of wheels 
has taken place - moves away from the runway under its own power.
If a damaged aircraft is not removed from the runway as quickly as the Du -
ty Airport Manager consider it necessary for a reasonable dispatch of the 
traffic, he shall be entitled to have the aircraft removed for the account of 
the owner or user.
6. Engine run-up
Engine run-up test may take place at GA-area.
7. Use of auxiliary power unit (APU)
Use of APU on aircraft stands shall be limited as far as possible.
APU may be used:
• 5 minutes after on block
• 5 minutes before leaving apron
Exemptions:
When the outside temperature (OAT) is below -10 degrees C or above +25 
degrees C, APU may be used as follows, unless otherwise instructed by 
marshaller:
• 5 minutes after on block
• 15 minutes before leaving apron
21. Noise Abatement Procedures
NIL
22. Flight Procedures
1. IFR Arrival
1.1 Aircraft will normally be cleared by ACC KØBENHAVN to MOMZE or 
URUPA.
1.2 Radio communication failure
Navigation aid designated for radio communication failure during IMC for arriv-
ing aircraft is
- L TL when RWY 10R is expected runway in use.
- L TL when RWY 28L is expected runway in use.
2. IFR Departure
2.1 Standard Instrument Departures
Standard Instrument Departures (SID) have not been established. At initial 
contact with TWR state prefered take-off position.
2.2 Omnidirectional departures
RWY 10R/L and 28L/R: Climb straight ahead to at least 700 FT MSL before 
turn is commenced.
3. VFR Flights
3.1 VFR reporting points, VFR holdings and VFR routes are established, 
see ANC 1:500 000.
4. Low Visibility Procedures
4.1 ATC will apply special safeguards and procedures during conditions 
of low visibility.
4.2 Low visibility procedures are prompted by ATC and will normally be 
introduced when the RVR is less than 550 M or during CAT II approaches.
4.3 Pilots will be informed when low visibility procedures are in operation 
by ATIS and/or RTF. Pilots will be informed by RTF when low visibility proce-
dures are cancelled.
4.4 ATC will apply special procedures to ensure separation between traffic on 
the maneuvering area.
4.5 Category II ILS approaches
4.5 a) The minimum distance between an aircraft on final approach carrying 
out a CAT II ILS APCH and any other proceeding aircraft is 6 NM. The separa-
tion must exist when proceeding aircraft passes THR.
4.5 b) Departing aircraft must have commenced take-off run before arriving 
aircraft, performing a CAT II ILS APCH, has left 2000 FT on final approach.
4.5 c) Pilots who intend to carry out a CAT II ILS APCH are to use the fol -
lowing phrase: ”Request category II ILS approach runway 28L”.
Above mentioned request shall be made to COPENHAGEN CONTROL and 
confirmed on first contact with AARHUS APPROACH.
4.5 d) Pilots performing CAT II ILS APCH will be informed in case of 
change to secondary power supply for electronic and visual aids.
5. Reduced Runway Separation Minima
5.1 With reference to AIP AD 1.1 section 8.4, reduced runway separation 
minima are approved for aircraft classified as category 1 or category 2.
5.2 The following reduced runway separation minima apply between air -
craft and must exist when a succeeding landing aircraft has crossed the 
threshold or a succeeding departing aircraft commences the take-off run.
5.2 a) 600 M between preceding category 1/2 and succeeding category 1.
5.2 b) 1500 M between preceding category 1/2 and succeeding category 2.
5.3 ATC will provide traffic information to succeeding aircraft when 
reduced runway separation is applied.

1. The following requirements are mandatory for right turns:
With reference to the general rules of the air in the vicinity of an aero-
drome, and provided that the pilot reports his/her intentions to VAM-
DRUP INFORMATION before a right turn is initiated or, when 
departing, before taking off, aircraft may execute right turns when 
approaching for landing and after taking off, if it does not endanger other 
air traffic.
2. Operations during the night period
In the period 2100-0600 (2000-0500) only after request to ADO 1 HR PN 
before closing time. No IFR traffic is permitted when AFIS is not estab-
lished.
3. Operation outside operational hours
If operations are conducted outside ADO service hours, the PIC must as 
soon as possible, leave a note in the tower mailbox, send an e-mail to 
afis@ekvd.dk or use the reporting system on the airports webpage, 
informing about the operations made during the period with self service

For school and training flights reference aerodrome noise abatement 
regulations. These can be obtained at the ADO.
6. Communications outside operational hours
Due to the general complexity of air traffic at and in the vicinity of the

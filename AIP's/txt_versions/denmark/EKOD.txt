1. School and training flights.
1.1 PPR are required for all school and training flights. To be submitted within 
operational hours. 
1.2 School and training flights only in the period 0600-2200 (0500-2100). 
For big jet aeroplanes (MTOM above 34000 KG or with more than 19 
seats), school- and training flights are permitted only MON-FRI EXC HOL 
in the period 0600-2100 (0500-2000). Due to environmental reasons, traf-
fic circuits in connection with landing exercises RWY 06/24 shall take 
place alternately north and south of the runway. 
2. Right turn
2.1 With reference to the general rules of the air in the vicinity of an aero-
drome, aircraft may, execute right turns when approaching for landing and 
after taking off, if it does not endanger other air traffic and provided that 
the pilot reports his/her intentions to the AFIS-unit before a right turn is ini-
tiated or, when departing, before taking off.
3. Helicopter
3.1 Within AFIS operating hours, helicopters shall contact AFIS before
commencing hovertaxi for information regarding possible drone activity.
21. Noise Abatement Procedures
Noise abatement provision
1. Flights in the periods 2200-2300 (2100-2200) and 
0500-0600 (0400-0500)
In the periods 2200-2300 (2100-2200) and 0500-0600 (0400-0500) 
the airport may be used by the following aircraft:
- Aeroplanes and helicopters with MTOM not exceeding 5700 KG.
- Propeller aeroplanes with MTOM below  9000 KG and noise 
certificated according to ICAO Annex 16, chapter 6 or chapter 10.
- Jet and turboprop aeroplanes (irrespective of MTOM) noise certificat -
ed according to ICAO Annex 16, chapter 3 and which fulfil the lower 
limits of the requirements (Flyover 89 EPNdB, Lateral 94 EPNdB and 
Approach 98 EPNdB)
The number of those operations is limited to 100 per month. 
2. Noise abatement provisions for ACFT with MTOM above 5700 KG
2.1 Take-off RWY 06
Departure towards ALSIE VOR: Turn right - climb on track 238° MAG to 
VOR ALS radial 010 and proceed inbound ALSIE VOR.
2.2 Take-off RWY 24
Right turn: Climb on track 238° MAG to OD DME 3.0 NM before turning right.
Departure towards ALSIE VOR: Climb on track 238° MAG to OD DME 4.0 
NM before turning left.
Departure towards TRANO VOR and KORSA VOR: Climb on track 238° 
MAG to OD DME 4.0 NM before turning left if the aeroplane in question is 
a jet aeroplane noise certificated according to ICAO Annex 16, chapter 2.
22. Flight Procedures
1. IFR Arrival
1.1 Aircraft will normally be cleared by ACC KØBENHAVN to RAVSI OR 
LAVBA.
1.2 Radio communication failure
Navigation aids designated for radio communication failure during IMC for 
arriving aircraft are: 
- FIX LAVBA when RWY 06 is expected runway in use.
- FIX RAVSI when RWY 24 is expected runway in use.
2. IFR Departure
2.1 Standard Instrument Departures
Standard Instrument Departures (SID) have not been established.
2.2 Omnidirectional departures
RWY 06/24: Climb straight ahead to at least 700 FT MSL before turn is 
commenced.
23. Additional Information
1. Parachuting
1.1 Parachuting may take place
2. Drone operation
2.1 Drone operations may take place. Check NOTAM for EKR25 and

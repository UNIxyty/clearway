See also "Noise Abatement Procedures", item 21.
4. Local Regulations.
4.1 At København/Kastrup a number of local regulations apply. The reg -
ulations are collected in a manual which is available from the AIS-C and at the 
Airport Office.
4.2 Among other subjects, the following of importance for the operation 
of aircraft on aprons are being mentioned:
a) The meaning of markings and signs.
b) Information about aircraft stands including docking guidance systems.
c) Information about taxiing from aircraft stands including taxi clearance.
d) Limitations in the operation of large aircraft including limitations in use of 
own power for taxiing.
e) Helicopter operations.
f) Marshaller assistance and towing assistance.
g) Use of engine power exceeding idle power.
h) Engine start-up and use of APU.
i) Fuel spillage.
j) Precautions during extreme weather conditions.
Further information about the regulations can be obtained from Ground Coor-
dinator on Airside Operations FREQ 131.405.
4.3 When a local regulation is of importance to the safe operation of air -
craft on the apron the information will be given to each aircraft from KASTRUP 
TWR or KASTRUP APRON.
4.4 The "Local Regulations" are published and updated by:
Copenhagen Airports A/S
Operational Compliance
P.O. Box 74
DK-2770 Kastrup.
5. Removal of damaged aircraft
5.1 In case an aircraft is damaged on a runway, it is the duty of the owner 
or user of such aircraft to ensure that it is removed as soon as possible. E.g. in 
case of punctures, it may be necessary that an aircraft - before replacement of 
wheels has taken place - moves away from the runway under its own power.
5.2 If a damaged aircraft is not removed from the runway as quickly as 
the Duty Airport Manager consider it necessary for a reasonable dispatch of 
the traffic, he shall be entitled to have the aircraft removed for the account of 
the owner or user.
6. Taxiing, parking, start up and deicing
6.1 Marshaller assistance
The pilot may NOT proceed into an aircraft stand unless:
a) The Docking Guidance System is operational and ready, displaying the 
correct Aircraft type, or
b) A CPH Marshaller is present, providing guidance for the Aircraft onto the 
Stand. The CPH Marshaller are easily recognizable by wearing bright red 
hi-vis clothing and yellow/orange bats. The CPH marshallers also drive 
the FOLLOW ME vehicles.
During the stand-entry and parking phase the Pilot should ignore hand signal-
ling by any other ground staff present at the stand or in the loading bridge.
When marshaller assistance is compulsory for the particular Aircraft stand in 
question, the Pilot will be advised by the ATS-Unit.
Otherwise, Pilots should notice that in general Marshaller assistence for Taxi  
and Stand entry guidance will be available only ON REQUEST. The mar-
shaller assistance is free of charge.
6.2 Taxiing
It is the responsibility of the taxiing pilot to maintain a safe distance to other air-
craft and obstacles.
Particular attention should be given when passing other aircraft at taxiway in-
tersections, at holding positions and when entering an aircraft parking stand.
Between runways and taxiways, on taxiways, aircraft must follow the yellow 
guidelines. However, aircraft with MTOM of 7,000 KGS and below may deviate 
from the guidelines as per instruction from ATC or the Marshaller.
Aircraft must not perform powered U-turns on taxiways in the apron areas.
In the apron areas minimum engine power shall be used as far as possible, and 
use of reverse thrust for manoeuvring to and from a stand is not permitted.
Anti-collision lights must be activated whenever engines are operating.
The shoulder width of some taxiways does not conform fully with the ICAO rec-
ommendations. Due to insufficient width in some curves the use of those par-
ticular taxiways is therefore restricted to certain aeroplane types. 
Approved taxi routes - complying with ICAO recommendations - for certain 
types of aeroplanes are shown on the Ground Movement Charts. However, the 
approved taxi routes for A380, AN124 and C5 do not fully comply with ICAO 
recommendations for ICAO Code F aircraft due to insufficient runway, taxiway 
and shoulder width. But when following the permitted taxi routes the wing tip 
clearance will comply with the recommendations.
TWY A1, A2 and E1 shall not be used by aeroplanes larger than ICAO code 
letter C when an aircraft is on final approach RWY 22R.
TWY N2 is not to be used by aeroplanes larger than ICAO code letter C except 
when being towed by tractor.
A speed-limit of maximum 10KT applies for ICAO code letter E aeroplanes 
when taxiing on TWY W.
Aircraft movements must never coincide on adjacent aircraft stands with over-
lapping safety lines. Aircraft must not simultaneously taxi into and/or taxi out/
pushback from any two adjacent stands.
Taxi-out or push-back from aircraft stands must not be executed without ap-
proval from KASTRUP APRON on FREQ 121.905.
Aircraft relocation: Initial call regarding aircraft relocation to APRON ARRIVAL.
Whenever operationally feasible, all multi-engine aircraft are requested to shut 
down as many engines as possible while taxiing and holding on the ground.
This in order to reduce the high emission of nanoparticles from jet engines due 
to combustion of fossil fuel. The active cooperation of the flight crews involved 
is appreciated.
6.3 Parking
When taxiing onto a stand with marshaller assistance the pilot-in-command 
must ignore handsignals from ground personnel other than authorized mar-
shallers.
Some stands are provided with guide-markings on the surface, intended for 
parking into the wind of certain aircraft types. Marshaller assistance is compul-
sory when using these markings.
Multi-engine propeller aeroplane are requested to enter stand with one engine 
operating only.
In strong crosswind conditions, requests for parking into the wind will be ap-
proved only for certain aircraft types and under provision that:
- the aircraft owner/operator can substantiate either a technical, structural or 
operational need for such parking, and
- the aircraft stand is designated for such parking.

For approval contact KASTRUP APRON.
When an aircraft has stopped "on-block" the main engines must be shut down 
and simultaneously high intensity strobelights, logo lights and floodlights that 
may effect the vision of other pilots, drivers or others in the vicinity, must be 
switched off. Transponder must be switched off or set to standby.
During handling of propeller aircraft, propeller must be secured against move-
ment.
Securing the propeller must be visibly marked.
ICAO code letter D and E aeroplanes must enter stand B10 via TWY Z and 
TWY M.
Aircraft taxiing onto stands B10, B15 and B17 must be accompanied by a FOL-
LOW ME vehicle while crossing the service road.
On Apron East marshaller assistance is available on request only.
On Apron West marshaller assistance is mandatory for parking of all aircraft.
On stand E71, E74, E83, E86 and E89, a Follow Me car will be provided for 
Code letter D and E aircraft when entering the stands. DGS is provided on the 
stands. ACFT should use minimum power setting entering the stands. In case
ACFT have to stop during entering the stands, towing to on block can be ex-
pected.
Parking of Helicopters shall take place on stands G110 and G111. The stands 
are available weekdays 0600-2200 (0500-2100). PPR for use of other stands. 
If possible, the rotors must be stopped while passengers embark and disem-
bark. If not, the ground staff must ensure that passengers are kept at a safe dis-
tance from engine intakes, exhausts and turning rotors.
Parking systems
For details of the Docking Guidance Systems (DGS), and of the systems in use 
on the individual stands, see paragraph 8. Docking Guidance Systems (DGS).
If the automatic DGS is switched off or has failed, the aircraft stand is not ready 
for entry. During start up the stand area is automatically scanned for obstacles 
by the system. If the aircraft has entered the stand - partially or fully - at this 
time, the scan process is likely to fail, and the system will display "FAIL". In this 
case a marshaller must be called to guide the aircraft correctly onto the stand. 
All stands are marked with guidelines on the surface.
Re-/defueling of aircraft with passengers embarking, on board, or disembarking 
the aircraft may only be carried out at Copenhagen Airport if the operator has 
an operational procedure that comply with the conditions set out in Regulation 
965/2012, CAT.OP.MPA.195, including the AMC1 to CAT.OP.MPA.195. Upon 
request the operator shall provide CPH with documentation of the procedure. If 
CPH finds that the conditions set out in Regulation 965/2012, 
CAT.OP.MPA.195, including the AMC1 to CAT.OP.MPA.195 are not complied 
with, CPH may with immediate effect forbid the operator to perform re-/defue-
ling with passengers embarking, on board or disembarking the aircraft until the 
operator has demonstrated that the conditions are complied with.
Discharging of water on aircraft stands and taxiways is not allowed. If the main-
tenance manuals dictate to drain or release water, for example to prevent freez-
ing of pipes or tanks on aircraft, containers to collect water must be used.
6.4 Push-back/Start up
6.4.1 Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM)
Copenhagen/Kastrup operates according to A-CDM standards.
A continuous and fully automatic data exchange with the Network Manager Op-
erations Center (NMOC) is established.
This data transfer will enable highly accurate early predictions of landing and 
departure times, which allow for more accurate and efficient calculation of the 
CTOT (when applicable) due to the use of local target take-off times (TTOT).
The basic NMOC procedures continue to apply but NMOC will take the local 
TTOT into consideration for CTOT calculation and will try to adjust it accordingly.
6.4.2 Advanced Network Integrated-Airport (ANI-Airport)
Copenhagen Airport is a coordinated airport, an ANI-Airport (Advanced Net-
work Integrated-Airport) in addition to being A–CDM (Airport – Collaborative 
Decision Making).
An ANI-Airport is an airport that has fully adopted the A-CDM concept by pro-
viding the full set of DPI messages (Departure Planning Information – P-DPI 
(Predicted – Departure Planning Information), E-DPI (Early – Departure Plan-
ning Information), T-DPI-t (Target – Departure Planning Information – Target), 
T-DPI-s (Target – Departure Planning Information - Sequenced), A-DPI (ATC-
Departure Planning Information) and C-DPI (Cancel – Departure Planning 
Information)) and that also provides API (Arrival Planning Information) messag-
es to NMOC (Network Manager Operations Center).
A permanent and fully automatic data exchange with the NMOC is established 
to share these DPI and API messages.
This data transfer will enable highly accurate early predictions of landing and 
departure times, allowing thus a more accurate and efficient calculation of slot 
allocation. The basic NMOC procedures continue to apply but NMOC will take 
the local TTOT (Target Take Off Time) into consideration for CTOT (Calculated 
Take Off Time) calculation and will try to adjust it accordingly.
In sequenced/nominal mode, updating the TOBT and therefore EOBT accord-
ing to TOBT is entirely beneficial for airlines which benefit from a more opti-
mised calculation of the CTOT.
DPI and API messages include TOBT, TSAT (Target Start Approval Time), 
TTOT as well as information on the arrival or departure flights and airport re-
sources.
With the introduction of P-DPI and G-API (General – Arrival Planning Informa-
tion) messages exchanged with Network Manager Systems, those messages 
may impact the ATFM (air traffic flow management) Network earlier than the 
start of A-CDM (EOBT -3 HR) and up to 48 HR before EOBT, and these data 
may be used for ATFM purposes.
Definitions
TOBT (Target off-Block Time) - The time that an AO or GHA estimates that an 
aircraft will be ready, all doors closed, boarding bridge removed, pushback ve-
hicle available and ready to start-up & push-back/taxi immediately upon receipt 
of ATC clearance. TOBT is displayed on DGS 30 minutes prior to the TOBT.
TSAT (Target Startup Approval Time) - The time provided by ATC that an air-
craft can expect start-up & push-back/taxi approval. TSAT is displayed on the 
automatic DGS when pilot has called for start/push-back.
TOBT and TSAT requirements
Irrespective of the TSAT, the aircraft must be ready for departure at the TOBT 
+/- 5 minutes as the TSAT may be revised forward at short notice.
Any time the TOBT or TSAT cannot be met, or an earlier departure is required, 
the TOBT must be updated expeditiously by the airline operator/ground handler.
Departure Clearance
Departure Clearance should be requested via Data Link Departure Clearance 
(DCL) at TOBT - 30 minutes.
If DCL is not available, Departure Clearance shall be requested via RTF/Clear-
ance Delivery (119.905) at TOBT - 30 minutes.
Start & Push-back/Taxi Clearance
Pilots must report/be ready for start & push-back/taxi at TOBT +/- 5 minutes to 
KASTRUP APRON on FREQ 121.905, All Aprons.
ATC will approve start & push-back/taxi or advise the pilots of the current TSAT.
Aircraft leaving the stand by own power shall obtain taxi instruction only, except 
in deicing situations, where the aircraft shall obtain start up approval as well.
Permission to push-back or taxi-out from a stand or position must not be re-
quested unless the tractor/aircraft is ready to perform the manoeuvre immedi-
ately.
Await activation of squawk until push-back or taxi clearance has been obtained.
6.4.3 Jet aircraft
On nose-in/push-back stands, jet engine start-up must take place only after 
permission has been obtained from the ground personnel, unless APU is un-
serviceable or the aircraft is not fitted with APU.
6.4.4 Propeller aircraft
Start up of multi-engine propeller aeroplane must always be executed in such 
a way that the noise around the aeroplane is reduced as much as possible.
a. On nose-in/push-back stands, one engine only must be started on the 
stand. Start up of the remaining engines shall wait until after push-back.
b. On turn-in/turn-out stands, it is requested to start one engine only on the 
stand.
Other regulations
6.5 Use of auxiliary power unit (APU)
Use of APU on aircraft stands shall be limited as much as possible.
Start-up of APU during refuelling is allowed only if the aircraft’s APU unit is lo-
cated outside the Fuelling Zones.
Note: Unless otherwise stated by the aircraft manufacturer or the airline opera-
tor, a Fuelling Zone is defined as a circular area with radius 3 M, surrounding 
any filling and venting points on the aircraft and fuelling equipment.
Note: The noise abatement provisions for Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup are es-
tablished in pursuance of § 82 of the Danish Air Navigation Act, cf. Consolida-
tion Act. no. 1036 of 28 August 2013, and Regulations for Civil Aviation, 
"Bestemmelser for Civil Luftfart" (BL), BL 3-40, Regulations on the abatement 
of noise from controlled aerodromes, Edition 2, 17 March 2003.
APU may be used:
- 5 minutes after "On Block".
- 5 minutes before Target Off-block Time.
Exemptions:

to be granted.
6.6 Deicing of aircraft
Deicing and antiicing of aircraft may take place only in the following areas:
- Deicing TWY A,
- Deicing TWY B, and
- Deicing TWY V.
In weather conditions where deicing might be relevant, Clearance Delivery 
(119.905) shall be informed as early as possible whether deicing is needed or not.
In the areas, the following channels, stop systems and post icing procedures 
shall be used: 
- For Deicing TWY A: 
• Channel: 130.655/123.405.
• Stop system: Yellow stop markings.
• Post deicing procedure: 
After receiving the "all clear" signal (thumbs up) from the ground crew,
taxi forward in the deicing area and stop before the illuminated stop line
to complete the post deicing procedures and checklists. When ready to
exit the deicing area, call ATC for taxi clearance.
- For Deicing TWY B: 
• Channel: 131.655.
• Stop system: Deicing traffic light showing green, amber or red light.
• Post deicing procedure: 
After receiving the "all clear" signal (thumbs up) from the ground crew,

to complete the post deicing procedures and checklists. When ready to
exit the deicing area, call ATC for taxi clearance,
and
- For Deicing TWY V:
• Channel: 131.980.
• Stop system: INOGON (stop abeam INOGON) for ICAO code letter C
and D aircraft. Yellow stop marking for ICAO code letter A and B aircraft.
• Post deicing procedure:
Before taxiing away from the area, aircraft shall receive the "all clear"
signal (thumbs up) from the ground crew and ATC taxi clearance.
The deicing areas are covered by a special friction surface, but still the braking 
action may be reduced due to deicing fluid.
6.7 Aircraft with mode S transponder.
Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup (EKCH) has installed a surface movement guid-
ance and control system utilising transponder mode S signals. Aircraft opera-
tors are asked to ensure that the transponders are able to operate according 
to ICAO specifications when the aircraft is on the ground (Annex 10, volume 
IV, 3.1.2.8.5.3 and 3.1.2.10.3.10).
Flight crew are required to select the assigned mode A (Squawk) code and 
activate the mode S transponder:
- from commencement of push-back or taxi, whichever comes first:
- after landing, until the aircraft is fully parked on stand. After parking the 
mode A code 2000 must be set before selecting OFF or STDBY.
Flight crew of aircraft equipped with a mode S transponder that has an aircraft 
identification feature should also select the aircraft identification (Idem 7 of the 
ICAO flight plan) before activating transponder.
Aircraft without mode S transponder.
Flight crews of aircraft not equipped with a mode S transponder must squawk 
assigned SSR-code ONLY when instructed to line up on the runway. Upon 
vacating the runway after landing flight crews on these aircraft SHALL switch 
off the transponder. At departure flight crews of aircraft not equipped with a 
mode S transponder are requested to state "No mode S transponder" to "Kas-
trup Apron" at first contact.
6.8  A380 Operations.
Take-off and landing with A388 is only permitted on RWY 04R and RWY 
22L.The overall width of runway + shoulders is 68 M. 
Exceeding idle power on outer engines shall not take place during taxiing, 
including taxiing on runways. 
Take-off thrust shall only be applied on the outer engines during the take-off 
run after reaching a ground speed above 40 knots.
6.9 B778 and B779 Operations.
Take-off and landing with B778 or B779 is only permitted on RWY 04R and 
RWY 22L.
7. Maintenance Areas.
Maintenance Areas are not covered by EU regulation 139/2014.
CPH has two maintenance areas. Maintenance Area North situated in the 
north-eastern part of the airport and Maintenance Area South situated in the 
southern part.
Maintenance Area North: When entering the area from TWY T a sign informs 
that you are now moving into a Maintenance Area. CPH is not responsible for 
aircraft movements and parking positions in the area.
Maintenance Area South: When entering the area from TWY N1 and TWY N2 
a sign informs that you are now moving into a Maintenance Area. The taxi-
ways have no centreline lights. Instead of centreline lights reflectors are 
embedded in the pavement on TWY N2 and on most of TWY N1. TWY N1 and 
TWY N2 have no TWY edge LGT AVBL, but are both provided with side stripe 
markings and centreline markings made in reflective materials to enhance visibil-
ity.
Marshaller assistance on TWY N1 and TWY N2 AVBL on REQ. The distance 
from the main gears of large aircraft to taxiway edges does not fully comply 
with EU regulation 139/2014.

III. Reporting 
As regards engine run-ups and use of APU, see Local Regulations for Copen-
hagen Airport, Kastrup and AIP Denmark AD 2 - EKCH-6/8 - 20. Local Aero-
drome Regulations. 
Note: The noise abatement provisions for Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup are 
established in pursuance of § 82 of the Danish Air Navigation Act, cf.  Consol-
idation Act. no. 1036 of 28 August 2013, and Regulations for Civil Aviation, 
"Bestemmelser for Civil Luftfart" (BL), BL 3-40, Regulations on the abatement 
of noise from controlled aerodromes, Edition 2, 17 March 2003. 
Chapter 7 of BL 3-40 reads as follows: 
"7. Punishment

of Section 149 of the Danish Air Navigation Act if the violation can be set 
against the person in question as intentional or grossly negligent. 
7.2 Penalty may be imposed on companies, etc. (legal persons) for vio -
lation of noise regulations even though the violation cannot be set 
against the legal person or a person attached to the legal person as wil -
ful or negligent. Similarly an owner of a one-man company may be pun -
ished with fine even though the violation cannot be set against the 
owner as wilful or negligent. No alternative sentence is laid down for 
penalty"
Part I
Rules for the use of the runway system 
The below provisions for use of the runway system are valid for all 
fixed-winged aircraft. Regarding provisions for helicopters see Part II, 
Chapter 3: Noise abatement provisions for helicopters. 
1. General rules 
1.1 RWY 04L/R and 22L/R are preferential runways. 
1.2 The preferential runways shall be used to the greatest extent possible 
2. Use of the runway system in the period 0600-2300, Danish time. 
2.1 For propeller and turboprop aeroplanes with an MTOM below 11000 kg 
there are no restrictions for use of the runway system in this period. 
2.2 For jet aeroplanes, irrespective of weight, and for propeller and turbo-
prop aeroplanes with an MTOM of 11000 kg or above, the following provisions 
shall apply:  
2.2.1 When the runway in use is RWY 04L/R, RWY 04R shall be used for 
take-off and RWY 04L for landing unless one of the runways cannot be used 
due to snow clearance, disabled aircraft, work on the runway, or runway condi-
tions. However, ATC can make use of parallel operations.
Note: Exempted from this provision are aircraft which due to their size are not 
able to use RWY 04L/22R.
2.2.2 When the runway in use is RWY 22L/R, RWY 22R shall be used for 
take-off and RWY 22L for landing unless one of the runways cannot be used 
due to snow clearance, disabled aircraft, work on the runway, or runway condi-
tions. However, ATC can make use of parallel operations. 
Note: Exempted from this provision are aircraft which due to their size are not 
able to use RWY 04L/22R.
2.2.3 RWY 12 and RWY 30 may be used when one or both of the preferential 
runways cannot be used due to 
a. the crosswind component on the preferential runways exceeding 15 KT,
b. reported RWYCC lower than 5 on any third of the preferential runways, 
c. the meteorological conditions being below minima for landing on the 
preferential runways, 
d. snow clearance, 
e. disabled aircraft, 
f. work on runways or taxiways or 
g. the condition of the runways. 
2.2.4 RWY 30 may, however, be used for landing without restrictions. 
2.2.5 A request for permission to deviate from the above provisions will be 
granted if the pilot-in-command claims safety reasons. 
3. Use of the runway system in the period 2300-0600, Danish time 
3.1 The following provisions shall apply to all aeroplanes: 
3.1.1 Take-off may take place only if an advance approval has been issued by 
Københavns Lufthavne A/S (Copenhagen Airports) - see Part II, item 2.3. 
3.1.2 When the runway in use is RWY 04L/R, RWY 04R shall be used for 
take-off and RWY 04L for landing unless one of the runways cannot be used 
due to snow clearance, disabled aircraft, work on the runway, or runway conditions.
Note: Exempted from this provision are aircraft which due to their size are not 
able to use RWY 04L/22R.
3.1.3 When the runway in use is RWY 22L/R, RWY 22L shall be used for take-
off and landing unless it cannot be used due to snow clearance, disabled air-
craft, work on the runway, runway conditions, when RWY22L is used for ILS 
CAT II+III approaches or when an extraordinary traffic situation causes delays 
of more than one hour. 
3.1.4 RWY 12 and RWY 30 are closed for take-off and landing, however, RWY 
30 may be used for landings when the crosswind component on the preferen-
tial runways exceeds 15 KT or the preferential runways are not available due 
to disabled aircraft, snow clearance, work on the runways, etc.
3.1.5 RWY 12 and RWY 30 may, however, be used in the following cases: 
a. For take-off and landing by vital flights such as ambulance and transplanta-
tion flights and similar flights if RWY 04L/R - 22L/R are not available ;
b. For landing in case Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup is planned as alternate 
airport and RWY 04L/R - 22L/R are no longer available after the flight has 
commenced and the use of any other alternate airport is not possible; 
c. For landing in case the aeroplane has experienced reduced airworthiness 
during flight, and the pilot-in-command estimates it necessary to land; 
d. For landing when the pilot-in-command declares an emergency situa-
tion. 
Part II
Take-off and landing restrictions 
In case of special meteorological conditions such as CBs, significant wind var-
iations etc. in the approach and take-off sectors, the ATC may, at its own or 
upon request from the pilot-in-command, deviate from the provisions in part II, 
if deemed necessary for safety reasons.

1.6 Final Approach RWY 04L and 22L. Radar Separation
For final approach to RWY 04L and RWY 22L a minimum radar separation of 
2.5 NM may be used between aircraft on final approach within 10NM from the 
threshold.
The procedure may be used provided that
- The approach radar is operative
- Braking action is reported good and runway occupancy time is not 
adversely affected by slush, snow, ice or the like.
- Runway turn-off points are visible from the TWR or by use of SMR.
- The wake turbulence separation minima are met.
- Aircraft approach speed is closely monitored by the controller.
- Pilots have been advised to vacate the runway rapidly.
1.7 Dependent Parallel Approaches
Dependent parallel approaches will be performed to runways 04L/04R or 22L/
22R.
When weather and runway conditions permit RWY 04L (22L) can be expected 
if not otherwise instructed by ATC.
The procedures may be expected daily 0500-2200 (0400-2100) if visibility is 
800 M or more.
The procedures are as follows:
a. Decision concerning applicable runway will be passed by approach con-
trol to the individual aircraft at the latest on intermediate approach.
b. A minimum of 1000 FT vertical or a minimum of 3 NM radar separation 
will be provided between aircraft until they are established on parallel 
ILS's.
c. Minimum radar separation provided to aircraft established on the localizer 
course will be 3 NM between aircraft on the same localizer course (with 
additional longitudinal separation as required for wake turbulence), and 
2,5 NM between successive aircraft established on parallel ILS’s.
The minima mentioned above may be reduced when:
• adequate separation can be provided by the aerodrome controller when 
each aircraft is continuously visible to the controller, or
• each aircraft is continuously visible to pilots-in-command of the other 
aircraft concerned and the pilots thereof report that they can maintain 
their own separation, or
• of the succeeding aircraft reports that he has the preceding aircraft in 
sight and can maintain separation.
d. Additional longitudinal separation will not be provided for wake turbulence 
reasons, between aircraft on final approach to 04R/22R following aircraft 
on final approach 04L/22L.
1.8 Precision Approach. Category II/III Operations
The operations are subject to the following procedures and conditions:
a. ATC procedures
CAT II approaches to RWY 04L and CAT II/III approaches to RWY 22L 
will under normal conditions be allowed only if the runway is not used for 
departures.
b. Pilot procedures
Pilots who intend to carry out a Category II/III ILS approach are to use the 
following phrase:
"Request Category II (or III) ILS approach runway ....... (mention runway 
number)".
Above mentioned request shall be made to either MALMO CONTROL or 
to COPENHAGEN CONTROL and confirmed on first contact with 
COPENHAGEN APPROACH.
c. Information given during final approach:
Change to secondary power supply for electronic and visual aids, if the 
aircraft has passed DME CH 5 NM for RWY 04L and DME OXS 5 NM for 
RWY 22L.
1.9 IFR Visual Approach
In case of missed visual approach follow the corresponding RWY ILS 
missed approach procedure.
1.10 ILS facilities. False signals
During testing of ILS-facilities, false signals are likely to be received by 
approaching aircraft, but should be disregarded. Special warnings will be 
issued via ATIS.
1.11 Communication after landing
After landing, remain on KASTRUP TOWER until otherwise instructed by 
ATC.
2. IFR DEPARTURE
2.1 Standard Instrument Departures
Departing aircraft certified for RNAV 1 operations will be assigned a
RNAV 1 (GNSS required) SID. Aircraft not certified for RNAV 1 operations will 
be assigned a detailed departure clearance.
SIDs are described on pages EKCH SID RWY 04L, RWY 04R, RWY 22L, 
RWY 22R, RWY 12 and RWY 30.
For aircraft not following SID, minimum turning altitude after take-off is 600 FT, 
unless further restricted by noise abatement procedures for the relevant run-
way (see SID pages).
2.2 Flight planning
Flight planning shall be via an appropriate SID.
Note:
a. SID KOPEX only for propeller ACFT.
b. SID NEXEN and LANGO only for jet ACFT.
c. SID SIMEG and SALLO penetrates Swedish territory. Operators not per -
mitted to overfly Swedish territory shall flightplan via SID BETUD. MAX 
requested FL 70 until BETUD.
d. SID VEDAR not AVBL for traffic re-entering København FIR beyond 
VEDAR. Alternate is SID GOLGA.
For destinations within København, Roskilde or Malmö TMA flights may be 
planned direct between aerodromes.

2.3 Climb profile
For ATC purposes, operators of jet aircraft should select an initial climb profile 
with a low acceleration altitude, followed by a continuous acceleration to at 
least minimum clean speed. Operators of jet aircraft not applying such profile 
shall inform ATC. 
2.4 Filing of Flight Plan
For destinations outside København, Roskilde or Malmö TMA the SID termi-
nation point shall be stated as the first route point in the flight plan, followed 
by:
a. the designator of the ATS route to join, or
b. DCT to the next significant point.
For destinations within København, Roskilde or Malmö TMA, state DCT or 
other specified routing.
2.5 ATC clearance delivery
Departing IFR traffic shall contact Clearance Delivery on 119.905 prior to 
TOBT in order to obtain ATC clearance. Clearance is available from TOBT -30 min. 
At initial contact aircraft type and de-icing need shall be stated.
2.6 Level restrictions
SIDs may include a published initial cleared level and may also include
level restrictions at specific significant points.
Cleared levels, issued explicit by ATC, shall override the published
cleared level. 
23. Additional Information
KASTRUP APRON
1. Aircraft movements on Apron North requires prior permission from Kas -
trup Apron. A permission obtained from Kastrup Apron is to be treated in 
content like an instruction and is to be observed.
2. During peek hours 3 units may be active to control the traffic on Apron 
North:
Sequence planner.
Outbound position (controls all of the outbound traffic)
Inbound position (controls all of the inbound traffic)
Each of the positions is responsible for its own traffic and will provide 
apron service on the corresponding frequency. 
3. KASTRUP APRON will provide taxi-instructions in Apron North until the 
area of responsibility. (See Area of Responsibility Chart).
4. During periods with low traffic intensity one or two positions may be 
responsible for all three area, but apron service will be provided on three 
separated frequencies simultaneously. The frequencies will be combined 
by ATC.
KASTRUP TOWER
1. During parallel runway operations two runwaycontrollers, call-sign "KAS -
TRUP TOWER", are active each with their own runway and area of 
responsibility (See Area of Responsibility Chart).
Note: During single runway operations special rules and areas will be in force.
2. Normally one ground controller, call-sign "KASTRUP TOWER", is  active 
with his own area of responsibility. (See Area of Responsibility). All in- 
and outbound traffic can expect to be instructed to change to this ground 
controller, call-sign "KASTRUP TOWER" from "KASTRUP APRON" or 
from another "KASTRUP TOWER". Pilots shall not change frequency 
without ATC instructions.
3. During periods with low traffic intensity one runwaycontroller may be 
responsible for all areas, therefore all frequencies will be combined by 
ATC.
Arrival
For permitted taxiroutes, depending on aircraft type, see GMC-1 to GMC-8.
KASTRUP TOWER will give permission to cross RWY 12/30. Depending on 
parking stand KASTRUP TOWER will allocate traffic to the western or eastern 
part of the aerodrome.
Departure
KASTRUP TOWER will give permission to cross RWY 12/30.
a Ref: PANS-RAC, Doc 4444. Procedures for Air Navigation Services - 
Rules of the Air and Air Traffic Services.
Thirteenth Edition Part V - Aerodrome Control Service.
AIP GEN 1.7-3 Item 4.7.
Bullet 4 is not applicable and permission will not be granted.
Stop Bars
Stop bars are used H24 at all runways - active as well as inactive.
Crossing of a lit stop bar is prohibited. Traffic may proceed only with explicit 
clearance from ATC and only after the stop bar has been switched off.
If a stop bar is out of service the following contingency measures are in force:
If the stop bar cannot be switched off:
a. An alternative taxi route where the stop bars are functioning will be used 
primarily.
b. If an alternative taxi route is not available, ATC will place a Follow Me car 
ahead of the aircraft with the explanation that the stop bar is out of service 
and that ATC will confirm by RTF when to cross the stop bar.
c. If a Follow Me car is not available, ATC will confirm by RTF when to cross 
the stop bar with the explanation that the stop bar is out of service.
If the stop bar cannot be switched on:
d. When visibility is above 3000 metres the runway can stay in operation.
e. When visibility is below 3000 metres the runway can only be used with an 
airport vehicle guarding the inoperative stop bar until a physical barrier has 
been established across the taxiway.
ATIS (ARR and DEP) and DEP clearances via datalink
1.1 ATIS (ARR and DEP) and DEP clearances (DCL) via datalink (ARINC/
SITA) are available. Aircraft equipped with ACARS compliant with ARINC 623 
Protocol will be able to use the datalink service. If unsuccessful, request DCL 
by voice from ATC.
1.2 Earliest time for obtaining predeparture clearance via datalink (ACARS) is 
30 minutes prior to TOBT. Latest time for obtaining clearance is at TOBT. The 
cockpit acknowledgement of the clearance has to be sent via datalink within 5 
minutes after receiving the clearance. 
Limitations in ATIS
1.1 To keep the length of the ATIS broadcast within the recommended 
30 seconds the following apply:
a. Flow restrictions will not be broadcast. The pilot-in-command must con -
sult the Airport Briefing Office to obtain information about valid flow 
restrictions.
b. Information about variation in wind direction will be broadcast only if the 
mean wind velocity is 6 KT or more.
c. Information about ice and snow conditions on taxiways and parking areas will 
be collected into a general information based on the worst values for the area
Gliding and Hang Gliding
1.1 Gliding not allowed at AD.
Flights in patterns or lanes (e.g.photoflights) with a duration of more than 15 
minutes.
1. Do not expect permission to execute the flight inside EKCH CTR’s lateral
limitations below 4000FT.
2. Do not expect permission to execute the flight in the part of EKCH TMA
and EKRK TMA with the lower limit at 1500FT in the following hours:
a. Monday to Friday 06 - 10 Danish time and 17 - 22 Danish time
b. Sunday 17 - 22 Danish time.
3. Are expected to be executed at altitudes of 1000FT or FL, e.g. 5000FT,
6000FT, FL 70 etc. within Copenhagen Area.
4. Might be repositioned or cancelled by WS-ATCC (Watch Supervisor Air 
Traffic Control Center) in coordination with ATC
EKCH TWR, EKCH APP and EKRK TWR/APP, on the day for the flight
due to the actual traffic situation.

3.  Low Visibility Procedures
3.1 ATC will apply special safeguards and procedures during conditions of low 
visibility. 
3.2 Criteria for activation of LVP
Low Visibility Procedures are prompted by ATC and will normally be intro-
duced when the RVR is less than 550 M or during CAT II/III operations.
3.3 Pilots will be informed when Low Visibility Procedures are in operation by 
ATIS and/or RTF. Pilots will be informed via RTF when Low Visibility Proce-
dures are cancelled.
3.4 The following procedures will apply:
a. ATC Procedures
When RVR is below 550 M, TKOF PSN A and D will be used for RWY 09
and TKOF PSN K for RWY 27. When RVR is below 350 M, ATC can only
allow one aircraft on the manoeuvering area at a time during take-off and
landing. Aircraft will additionally receive Marshaller guidance on Aprons.
b. Pilot procedures. 
Pilots should on own initiative report "runway vacated" when the aircraft is
fully clear of the runway. Pilots should on own initiative report "on Apron
North/South" when the aircraft is fully clear of the manoeuvring area.
4. Precision Approach. Category II / III Operations
4.1 The operations during CAT II / III approaches are subject to the following 
procedures and conditions.
a. ATC procedures.
The minimum distance between an aircraft on final approach on a CAT lI /
III ILS approach and any other preceding aircraft will for CAT II not
be less than 5 NM and for CAT III not less than 8 NM. The separation
must be established at the latest when preceding aircraft passes THR. 
Departing aircraft must have commenced take-off run, before arriving air-
craft has left 2000 FT on final approach. 
b. Pilot procedures.
Pilots who intend to fly a CAT II / III ILS approach are to use the fol-
lowing phrase: "Request Category II (or III) ILS approach runway …….
(mention runway number)" 
Above mentioned request shall be made to COPENHAGEN CONTROL
and confirmed on first contact with BILLUND APPROACH.
c. During final approach ATC will inform the pilot of following: 
Change to secondary power supply for electronic and visual aids, if the
aircraft has passed OSLAS BIL 5.6 NM for RWY 09 or ELRIT LEL 5.5 NM
for RWY 27. 
5. VFR Flights
5.1 VFR reporting points and VFR holdings are established. 
For further see ANC 1:500 000 Denmark and/or VFG Denmark.
5.2 All departing flights shall submit flight plan or abbreviated flight plan 
to ARO before departure. 
5.3 Departure clearance shall be requested at Billund TWR on 129.505. 
23. Additional Information
1. Gliding
1.1 Glider areas within Billund TMA/CTR, see AD 2 - EKBI Glider Areas 
in TMA/CTR.
1.2 Glider Areas.
Each glider area will be activated on request by Billund Approach according to 
agreement between Billund Approach and Dansk Svæveflyver Union (DSvU).
Announcement of active glider area will - if necessary due to heavy load on the 
communication channels - be broadcasted on Billund ATIS with information of 
upper limits and period of activity.
1.3 VFR flights may obtain information about active glider areas on the 
TOWER/APPROACH frequency.
A request for clearance to pass an active area will normally be complied with, 
but VFR flights cleared to pass an active area will not receive the prescribed 
traffic information and advice to avoid collision normally given by ATS for air-
space class C.
1.4 IFR flights will be separated from active glider areas or from individ -
ual flights in mentioned areas.
Note: Observe the fact, that gliding may take place below the areas, whether 
the areas are active or not.
1.5 Two glider reporting lines are established:
Karlskov line:
From 55 46 31N 008 35 41E to 55 48 34N 009 41 43E.
Vandel line:
From 55 40 07N 008 36 24E to 55 42 10N 009 42 16E.
2. Higher code letter aircraft operations
2.1 The RWY is classified as 4E/PA-3B. Procedures have been imple -
mented to handle higher code letter aircraft operations. For operations with 
higher code letter aircraft contact briefing@bll.dk.
3. Stop bars
3.1 If a stop bar is out of service the following contingency measures are
in force: 
If the stop bar cannot be switched off:
a. An alternative taxi route where the stop bars are functioning will be
used primarily.
b. If an alternative taxi route is not available, ATC will place a Follow
Me car in front of the aircraft with the explanation that the stop bar is
out of service and that ATC will confirm by RTF when to cross the stop
bar.

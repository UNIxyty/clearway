If Thimarafushi Tower is unmanned, contact Male Control on telephone 3322071, 3317202,  
9987202 for ATC clearance. pilot shall monitor and transmit position information on Thimarafushi  
Tower frequency before entering runway for departure and until passing 3500 feet, or until leaving  
Thimarafushi AFIS zone. 
 
Co-ordination between Thimarafushi AFIS Unit and Maldives Air Traffic Control Centre  
 
Thimarafushi AFIS unit has a telephone line (3024706) to ensure that MATCC is informed  
regarding departures, arrivals to and from Thimarafushi Airport.  
 
Information provided to aircraft by Thimarafushi AFIS Unit  
 
a) Meteorological information for aircraft about to take- off or to land, including SIGMET 
information.  
E.g. the current surface winds, direction and speed, QNH, air temperature, visibility.  
b) The most suitable runway for use.  
c) Information that is essential to the safe operation. E.g. Construction or maintenance work.  
d) Rough or broken surfaces on a runway or a taxiway, whether marked or not;  
e) Water on a runway;  
f) Other temporary hazards, including parked aircraft and birds on the ground or in the air;

Responsibilities of, and procedures for pilots operating to and from Thimarafushi Airport  
 
Thimarafushi AFIS zone is class G airspace. ATC will not provide separation within Thimarafushi AFIS 
zone. Traffic Information will be provided of other known IFR and VFR traffic.  
 
When operating on or in the vicinity of Thimarafushi Airport, pilots must, on the basis of the information 
received from the Thimarafushi AFIS Unit combined with their own knowledge and observations, decide 
on the course of action to be taken to ensure separation from other aircraft, ground vehicles and 
obstacles.  
 
It is essential that pilots establish and maintain two- way radio communication with Thimarafushi AFIS 
Unit and that they report their positions, levels and all significant maneouvres and intentions to 
Thimarafushi AFIS unit, since the efficiency of the Thimarafushi AF IS is dependent on the information 
received.

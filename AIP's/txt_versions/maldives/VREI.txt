Coordination between Ifuru AFIS Unit and Maldives Air Traffic Control Centre  
 
Ifuru AFIS unit has a telephone line (658 5525) to ensure that MATCC is informed regarding departures, 
arrivals to and from Ifuru Airport. 
 
Information provided to aircraft by Ifuru AFIS Unit 
 
a) Meteorological information for aircraft about to take -off or to land, including SIGMET 
information. 
E.g. the current surface winds, direction and speed, QNH, air temperature, visibility. 
b) The most suitable runway for use. 
c) Information that is essential to the safe operation. E.g. Construction or maintenance work.  
d) Rough or broken surfaces on a runway or a taxiway, whether marked or not;  
e) Water on a runway; 
f) Other temporary hazards, including parked aircraft and birds on the ground or in the air;

Responsibilities of, and procedures for pilots operating to and from Ifuru Airport  
 
When operating on or in the vicinity of Ifuru Airport, pilots must, on the basis of the information received 
from the Ifuru AFIS Unit combined with their own knowledge and observations, decide on the course of 
action to be taken to ensure separation from other aircraft, ground vehicles and obstacles. 
 
It is essential that pilots establish and maintain two -way radio communication with the Ifuru AFIS Unit 
and that they report their positions, levels and all significant maneuvers and intentions to the Ifuru AFIS 
unit, since the efficiency of the Ifuru AFIS is dependent on the information received.

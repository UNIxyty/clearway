AD 1 AERODROMES / HELIPORTS - INTRODUCTION
AD 1.1 AERODROME/HELIPORT - AVAILABILITY
1   General Conditions under which aerodromes / heliports and associated 
facilities are available for use
1.1   Introduction:
This section contains information an all aerodromes which are:-
a)ports of entry;
b)aerodromes for domestic use.
1.2   Aerodromes: Administration.
The administration of an aerodrome is the responsibility of the licensee.
1.3   Conditions of availability:
a)An aerodrome may be used by a particular aircraft, provided due account has
been taken of the meteorological conditions obtaining at the time, provided the
aircraft’s performance and PCN is consistent with the physical characteristics of
the aerodrome.
b)Pilots must ensure that prior permission is obtained from the licensee for the
operation of all aircraft to and fr om aerodromes licensed in the private category.
c)The Defence Act 44 of 1957 states that no civilian aircraft may land at a military
aerodrome without prior permission being obtained from :
The Chief of the Air Force 
S.A Air Force Headquarters
Operations Room
TEL: (012) 312-2034
i)It must be pointed out, however, that even with prior permission, persons using
such aerodromes do so at their own ri sk as the Defence Act also states that the
Department of Defence shall not be liable to any person who makes use of the
aerodrome or for loss or for damage resulting from damage to property caused
by or arising out of the said defence service or property. 
1.4   Applicable ICAO documents.
The standards and recommended practices contained in Annex 14 are appliedwith the exception of the differences noted hereunder.
1.5   Maintenance of aerodrome movement areas:
It is the responsibility of the relevant airport authority to maintain the aerodrome ina satisfactory condition.15 OCT 16

1.6   Dissemination of information on condition of paved surfaces:
a)Information on surface condition of runways, taxiways and aprons will be
published, when necessary, in NOTAM.
b)(b) At aerodromes where an ATS unit is established, if a runway is affected by
standing water not associated with snow, slush or ice at any time during the
approach of an aircraft for landing the depth and location of such standing water is
notified by the aerodrome authority direct to the ATS at that aerodrome for
transmission to the aircraft.
c)At certain Airports Company Airports tests have been carried out using a
Mumeter to determine the surface friction characteristics, when wet, of paved
runways, (ICAO Annex 14, Attachment B, para. 7.3.7 refers). The minimum
Mumeter value for which a runway will be classified as “slippery when wet” is 0,5.If the friction of a runway is found  to be below this value, then such 
information
shall be promulgated by NOTAM.
1.7   Strength:
a)The assessment of the bearing strength of a runway is made complicated
because the effective loads imposed by an aircraft of given weight vary with thenumber and layout of the wheels comp rising the landing gear and the tyre
pressure.
It is desirable that aircraft operators should be able to determine in advance for
themselves, within reasonable limits,  whether a particular runway is strong enough to
accept the safe movement of a particular aircraft.
A system has been devised which expresses the bearing strength of a runway in
a simple form and which provides sufficient information for the assessment in relation
to this of the loads imposed by particular types of aircraft.
b)Pavement Classification Number (PCN):
The bearing strength of a runway is defined by a number (PCN).
If an operator proposes a movement or series of movements at an aerodrome, the
aircraft PCN should be ascertained, as a function of single isolated wheel loading and
tyre pressure.If the resultant aircraft ACN is equal to or less than the published PCN for the
runway it is intended to use, the bearing strength of that runway is sufficient for the
proposed movements. Conversely, if the aircraft ACN is higher than the published
PCN for the runway, the bearing strength may not be sufficient and the operator must
obtain the prior permission of the aerodrome licensee for operations at that
aerodrome.
The attention of all operators and pilo ts is drawn to the circumstances and
conditions prevailing at many of the smal ler aerodromes. Some of these aerodromes
are unattended and, in spite of maintenanc e, holes and other damage may be caused
by rodents overnight. Further, should an aerodrome become unserviceable for a short
period after rain, unserviceability markers ma y not be displayed. Circumstances such
as these will temporarily reduce the PCN of unpaved runways.15 OCT 16

1.8   Aerodrome reference point (ARP)
The aerodrome reference point is the designated geographical location of an
aerodrome. The point chosen is usually  one situated near the geometric centre of the
aerodrome.
1.9   Aerodrome reference temperature (ART).
The aerodrome reference temperature is the monthly mean of the mean daily
temperature (24 hours) for the hottest month of the year (T 1) (the hottest month being
that which has the highest mean daily tem perature) plus one-thir d of the difference
between the monthly mean of the maximum daily temperature for the same month (T2)
and the aforementioned monthly mean temperature (T1) i.e.Both T1, and T2 should
be averaged over a period of years.
1.10   Rescue and fire fighting facilities.
Adequate rescue and fire fighting vehicles, equipment and personnel have been
provided at most of the aerodromes available for use by international commercial air
transport.
The scale of protection has been determined in accordance with the guidance
given in Attachment C to Annex 14.
At the other major aerodromes the resc ue and fire fighting equipment provided is
usually suitable to their operating requirements.
1.11   Visual ground signals:
a)Of the visual ground signals contained in Appendix A to Annex 2, none have
significance in the Republic of South Africa, with the exception of Para. 4.2.4
“Closed runways and taxiways”.
b)Closed manoeuvring areas, runways and taxiways.
1. Day markings.
Crosses of a single conspicuous colour, preferably white, displayed horizontally on
the manoeuvring area shall indicate the limit s of an area unfit for the movement of
aircraft. In the case of runways and taxiwa ys the crosses shall be displayed at each
end of the unserviceable part and over the ent ire length of the unserviceable part at
distances of not more  than 300 M if the unserviceable part exceeds a distance of
300 M.
2. Night markings.On manoeuvring areas used at night, unserviceable areas shall be 
delineated by
fixed aviation red lights placed along the edge and at such corners of the area as may
be necessary clearly to indicate the extent of the area, except that, where aircraftmovements are limited to runways and taxiways, a runway or taxiway or portions
thereof may be closed for taxiing purposes by placing aviation red lights across the
entrance and exit of the section rendered unusable by reason of an unserviceablearea, and by 
extinguishing the runway or taxiway lights between the delimiting red
lights.15 OCT 16

c)Traffic pattern indicator.
A traffic pattern indicator is used to indicate whether a right or left hand circuit
should be followed in respect of a specific runway direction.
The indicator comprises, depending on the number of runways, a series of L
markings around the wing cone circle.
The orientation of the markings coincide with that of the runways at the aerodrome
where the indicator is displayed.
The L-shaped markings indicate whether a left or right hand circuit is in force. Thus
when runway a or runway b is in use, a right hand circuit must be flown while, when
runways c or d are in use, a left hand circuit is applicable.
1.12   Stop bar Procedures
Signs markings and lighting act as safety nets to prevent drivers or pilots from
entering a runway incorrectly. Stop bars are provided at certain airports to assist
in protecting the runway against a Runway  Incursion. Airports using stop bars
today typically equip the CAT II/III holding point as a compliment to the pavement
marking and signage according to ICAO.
A stop bar consists of a row of unidirectional lights embedded in the pavement and
spaced equally across the taxiway at the associated holding point, normally at
right angles to the centerline. They show red towards an approaching aircraft
when lit. Stop bars are sometimes installed in association with green lead-on lights
which are a continuation of the taxiway centerline lighting beyond the stop bar.
The lead-on lights are interlinked with the stop bar so that when the stop bar is
red, the green centerline beyond the stop bar is unlit and vice versa.
Procedures for Stop bar Use
1) Pilots and Drivers shall never cross a red (lit) stop bar.
2) If instructed to cross a red stop bar pilots and drivers should challenge the ATC
to switch off the stop bar or provide alternative routing.
3) Pilots and Drivers may only cross a deselected stop bar/holding point when the
appropriate voice clearance has been issued by the ATC and read-back by the
pilot/driver. Pilots and Drivers should be careful not to assume clearance to
cross/enter a runway has been issued if the stop bar is not illuminated.
4) Should a stop bar fail ATC shall endeavour to provide an alternate clearance
that does not route via the failed stop bar.
5) Where a stop bar has failed and there is no alternative routing available or the
stop bar has failed at a runway entrance, a procedure shall be published eithervia NOTAM or promulgated in the AIP describing under what conditions pilotsand drivers may be allowed to cross a lit stop bar. Should no such procedure15 OCT 16

be published the pilots and drivers shall only cross the lit stop bar under the
direction of a Follow-Me vehicle when ATC has given an explicit clearance forthe Follow-Me vehicle to lead the aircraft onto/across the runway.
6) When a Follow-Me vehicle is used Pilots will be required to report the Follow-
Me vehicle in sight to the ATC. Thereafter all Radio Transmissions will bedirected to the Vehicle until the Driver of the Follow-Me vehicle reportsstanding down.
7) When issuing a Conditional Clearance, ATC should only extinguish the stop
bar when the subject of the condition has passed and it is safe for the aircraftor vehicle to enter the runway at that entry point at that time. 
8) Should a pilot or driver require clarific ation on a clearance issued they should stop
before the stop bar and request clarification from the ATC prior to crossing any
holding point. If in Doubt STOP and ask.15 OCT 16

AD 2.9 SURFACE MOVEMENT GUIDANCE  AND CONTROL SYSTEM AND MARKINGS
1 Use of aircraft stand ID signs, TWY guide lines and 
visual docking / parking guidance system of aircraft 
stands.1) Allocation of parking
i) ACFT landing to CTC apron office on FREQ 122.65 
MHz prior to top of descent or when within VHF range 
for parking bay allocation. Parking bays to be confirmed upon landing. ACFT to give the following 
INFO, ACFT type, REG, ETA, POB and last AP of 
DEPii) Parking bay INFO and REG is to be transmitted to 
SMC on FREQ 121.9 MHz on vacating RWY for TAX 
instructionsiii) Before entering the apron ACFT are to contact 
ACSA Apron office on FREQ 122.65 MHz to verify if 
their gate is still ava ilable. Pilots are not to enter into 
discussion with SMC with reference to bay allocation 
as this is not their function.
iv) TWY G2 access into South African Police Service Airwing unavailable.
2) Operators of non-scheduled flights requiring use of 
the main apron must inform ACSA apron office on 
email address CIAApron@airports.co.za not later 
than 24 hours prior for parking bay allocation. The notification must contain the following information: 
date and time of arrival, date and time of departure, 
long term parking arrangements (i.e. main apron or general aviation area), Name of aircraft operator and 
contact details, Name of ground handler and contact 
details.3) A docking system is installed on parking bays A3-
A17. The system works as FLW:
i. The system will display the ACFT type which means that is the type of  ACFT that will park in that 
stand.
ii. The pilot must follow the arrows displayed by the azimuth for this will guide the ACFT on the centreline 
of the PRKG bay.
iii. The system will also display speed of ACFT. ACFT must approach at a speed of not more than 5.40 
knots.
iv. If it is too fast it will display slow down.v. The system will also display distance from stopping 
position in meters and will count down in meters as it 
approaches.vi. As the ACFT moves closer than 3M stopping 
position it will count down in 0.2 of a meter. 
vii. Should system be inoperative then marshalling will be as normal.
4) Pushback Procedures
i) Pilots leaving AD must advise the Airport Manager, 
via the Apron Office of destination and the number of PAX and crew on board. Apron Office FREQ 
122,65MHz, call sign “CAPE TOWN APRON”. 
Operators and companies may pass the above INFO by telephone to (021) 9371280 or by FAX *(021)

visual docking / parking guidance system of aircraft stands.ii) Only the following information is to be passed to
Cape Town Ground Control FREQ 121.9MHz prior tostart up: Call-sign, Aircraft Registration, FL requested
and PRKG Bay. 
iii) ACFT are not to request pushback until the tug isconnected and ready to push. 
iv) An ACFT will commence pushback within 1 
minute of being given pushback.
v) The pilot is deemed responsible for the pushback 
and is to ensure that no incidents arise.
vi) Essential local traffic information will be passed by
air traffic control to the pilot in command for onward 
relay to the engineer. 
vii) All aircraft in addition will monitor frequency 
122.65 MHz whilst on the aprons.
5) Due to reduced wing-tip clearance distances all 
ACFT with a wing span of 52m or greater must use 
apron taxiways to only access the ACFT stands on 
the main aprons and not as a throughfare. ACFT using apron taxiways must reduce taxi speed to 10 
knots or below.
6) Due to the proximity of the service road to B10ACFT parking bay, ACFT that power out of this bay 
must adhere to the taxi guide lines markings.
7) 4 power in power out parking bays (B19, B22, B25 
and B28) in use on B north apron. These parking 
bays can also be used to park aircraft nose in.
8) All pilots operating the Boeing 777X (777-900) shall not extend the wingtips when taxing on taxiways 
& taxilanes. The wingtips must then remain folded for 
taxing to and from the parking bay. Taxiways & taxilanes are not configured to accommodate taxing 
code F aircrafts. The wingtips must only be extended 
when the aircraft is lined up at departure threshold.
2 RWY and TWY markings and LGT RWY 01/19 marked and lighted,
RWY 16/34 marked and lighted except the centreline 
only marked.
All TWY centreline, holding positions and TWY/RWY 
intersections marked.

7R e m a r k s REQUIREMENTS
Helicopters are not permitted to:-i) Hover training on or near the runway (including the grass area 
between the runway and taxiway and near the hangars or buildings) 
unless the ATC has given that specific helicopter permission to do so.
ii) Helicopters must fit in with the circuit trafficiii) A helicopter stationary on the runw ay or flight strip or in the hover 
renders the runway unsafe.
iv) Hover training to be done at the designated helicopter pads or at 
the ATC discretion. 
v) Helicopters, once given take off clearance from the helicopter pad 
must proceed to the runway and take off as per ATC clearance.
vi) The compass swing bay is not to be utilized as a hovering area or 
helipad.
vii) Due to proximity of parked ACFT, the apron is not part of the 
manoeuvring area and does not fall under ATC jurisdiction, no 
permanent parking in front of the terminal building, only used as drop 
off and go for ACFT.
viii) Pilots to exercise caution when  taxiing due to close proximity of 
parked ACFT.
HOLDING POINT
It was established that to ease congestion at the holding point 23, a 
second holding point be demarcated.
This in effect should leave a gap between the two points in which 
helicopters utilizing the Starlight helicopter pad can proceed without 
having to fly over aircraft holding at the holding point.
Holding point two (2) is the furtherest one from the runway and on 
busy days the ATC will hold all aircraft at this point and let one at a time 
through to the first holding point. Once cleared for take off the ATC, at their discretion will let another aircraft through to holding point one (1).
HELICOPTER OPERATIONS
Helicopter operational hours are from 0400 to 1700 Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Helicopter training on Saturday is  BTN 0400-1100, and on Tuesday 
and Thursday BTN 0400- 1800. No training permitted on Sundays and 
public holidays.
Departing helicopters are expected to  gain enough height as possible, 
to be clear of the residential areas on both sides of the aerodrome.

Note: All IFR TFC DEP FAVG outside of HR of duty of ATC must CTC Durban APCH on FREQ 125.75 MHz prior 
to departure for clearance to enter controlled airspace. If no CTC can be established on FREQ 120.6 MHz, ACFT 
are to get airborne and remain clear of controlled airs pace and obtain clearance on FREQ 125.75 MHz to enter 
controlled airspace.
All TFC DEP FM FAVG that enter the Durban TMA or fly to FALE are required to request startup prior to DEP.
(1) Use of AD by Tri-Axis Fixed Wing microlight ACFT permitted.
(2) Twin engined aircraft are to use ASPH TWY only at all times.(3) The control tower penetrates the Transitional Surface.(4) ACFT to park in designated areas only. 
For noise abatement procedure, helicopters are to approach at higher altitude over the residential area 
(flying a normal approach path) and to cross the aerodrome boundary fence at no less than 300FT whenever 
practical and safe to do so.15 APR 22

FAVG AD 2.22 FLIGHT PROCEDURES
FAVG AD 2.23 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
FAVG AD 2.24 CHARTS RELATED TO AN AERODROMEThe following deemed separation between arriving and departing IFR flights at King Shaka International 
and Virginia airports is based upon a Safety Assess ment conducted by ATNS and has been implemented to 
enhance efficiency as well as to ensure a safe, orderly an d expeditious flow of air traffic within the FALE/FAVG 
area of responsibility.
FAVG geographical position is 3NM east of the approach/t ake-off path of runway 06/24 at FALE and as such 
restricts IFR traffic to and from both airports.
This procedure will require IFR traffic departing from or arriving at FAVG, on ATC clearances to remain seaward 
of the coastline on headings, and will be deemed to be separat ed from IFR departing and arriving traffic at King 
Shaka International Airport (FALE).
This deemed separation will only be applicable when Surveillance Radar is in operation
at FALE.
In the absence of an IAP for IFR ACFT into FAVG the following PROC will apply, when WX minima restricts VMC 
descents into FAVG: inbound IFR ACFT to FAVG shall be accommodated on the ILS or VOR IAP to FALE to a 
minimum of 1000FT ALT. Should the ACFT not become VMC by 1000FT ALT, pilot will be requested to land at 
FALE.
Circuit: All circuits to be flown at 800FT and must be  conducted seawards. Downwind legs over land not 
permitted.
Pilots must exercise caution due to flocks of birds on AD.

Circuit joining procedures:
- All traffic within 5NM of the airfield must monitor and make regular position reports on frequency
131.10MHz.
- All inbound traffic shall approach the airfield at 2000FT ALT  from 5NM.
- A radio call must be made at 5 NM inbound at 2000FT ALT on VH F frequency 131.10 MHz.
- Join overhead at 2000FT ALT, to enter a left-hand pattern for  either runway 05/23 or 14/32.
- A further radio call must be made from overhead the airfield at 2000FT ALT to advise traffic of further
intentions.- Descend on the “dead side”, outside the active left-hand circ uit, to merge with the active circuit on the
downwind leg at 1200 FT.
- Standard circuit height for all aircraft 1200FT ALT except mi crolight aircraft which sha ll fly a “low level” circuit
at 900FT ALT. Standard radio calls must be made in the circuit.
- Orbits are not permitted in the circuit.
- Aircraft leaving the area must maintain 1500FT ALT until 5NM and call outbound on 131.10MHz. Aircraft
with dual-frequency monitoring capability are advised to also l isten out on 124.8MHz for inbound traffic.
- Transiting aircraft to avoid overflying the airfield and to m aintain 2000FT ALT from 5NM until past the airfield,
descending to 1500FT ALT thereafter until outbound at 5NM.- Aircraft turning right after take-off must remain below 900FT  ALT until 3NM before climbing to 1500FT ALT
to ensure no conflict with joining traffic.
- Circuit joining procedures herein to be adhered to by all gen eral aviation.
Non-standard operations/procedures may be conducted by FAWN Fix ed-Base Operators with the prior
consent of the Airport Authority.

AD 1 AERODROMES / HELIPORTS - INTRODUCTION
AD 1.1 AERODROME/HELIPORT - AVAILABILITY
1   General Conditions under which aerodromes / heliports and associated 
facilities are available for use
1.1   Introduction:
This section contains information an all aerodromes which are:-
a) ports of entry;
b) aerodromes for domestic use.
1.2   Aerodromes: Administration.
The administration of an aerodrome is the responsibility of the licensee.
1.3   Conditions of availability:
a) An aerodrome may be used by a particular aircraft, provided due account has
been taken of the meteorological conditions obtaining at the time, provided the
aircraft’s performance and PCN is consistent with the physical characteristics of
the aerodrome.
b) Pilots must ensure that prior permission is obtained from the licensee for the
operation of all aircraft to and from aerodromes licensed in the private category.
c) The Defence Act 44 of 1957 states that no civilian aircraft may land at a military
aerodrome without prior permission being obtained from :
The Chief of the Air Force 
S.A Air Force Headquarters
Operations Room
TEL: (012) 312-2034
i) It must be pointed out, however, that even with prior permission, persons using
such aerodromes do so at their own ri sk as the Defence Act also states that the
Department of Defence shall not be liable to any person who makes use of the
aerodrome or for loss or for damage resulting from damage to property caused
by or arising out of the said defence service or property. 
1.4   Applicable ICAO documents.
The standards and recommended practices contained in Annex 14 are applied
with the exception of the differences noted hereunder.
1.5   Maintenance of aerodrome movement areas:
It is the responsibility of the relevant airport authority to maintain the aerodrome in
a satisfactory condition.

1.6   Dissemination of information on condition of paved surfaces:
a) Information on surface condition of runways, taxiways and aprons will be
published, when necessary, in NOTAM.
b) (b) At aerodromes where an ATS unit is established, if a runway is affected by
standing water not associated with snow, slush or ice at any time during the
approach of an aircraft for landing the depth and location of such standing water is
notified by the aerodrome authority direct to the ATS at that aerodrome for
transmission to the aircraft.
c) At certain Airports Company Airports tests have been carried out using a
Mumeter to determine the surface friction characteristics, when wet, of paved
runways, (ICAO Annex 14, Attachment B, para. 7.3.7 refers). The minimum
Mumeter value for which a runway will be classified as “slippery when wet” is 0,5.
If the friction of a runway is found  to be below this value, then such 
information
shall be promulgated by NOTAM.
1.7   Strength:
a) The assessment of the bearing strength of a runway is made complicated
because the effective loads imposed by an aircraft of given weight vary with the
number and layout of the wheels comp rising the landing gear and the tyre
pressure.
It is desirable that aircraft operators should be able to determine in advance for
themselves, within reasonable limits, whether a particular runway is strong enough to
accept the safe movement of a particular aircraft.
A system has been devised which expresses the bearing strength of a runway in
a simple form and which provides sufficient information for the assessment in relation
to this of the loads imposed by particular types of aircraft.
b) Pavement Classification Number (PCN):
The bearing strength of a runway is defined by a number (PCN).
If an operator proposes a movement or series of movements at an aerodrome, the
aircraft PCN should be ascertained, as a function of single isolated wheel loading and
tyre pressure.
If the resultant aircraft ACN is equal to or less than the published PCN for the
runway it is intended to use, the bearing strength of that runway is sufficient for the
proposed movements. Conversely, if the aircraft ACN is higher than the published
PCN for the runway, the bearing strength may not be sufficient and the operator must
obtain the prior permission of the aerodrome licensee for operations at that
aerodrome.
The attention of all operators and pilo ts is drawn to the circumstances and
conditions prevailing at many of the smaller aerodromes. Some of these aerodromes
are unattended and, in spite of maintenance, holes and other damage may be caused
by rodents overnight. Further, should an aerodrome become unserviceable for a short
period after rain, unserviceability markers may not be displayed. Circumstances such
as these will temporarily reduce the PCN of unpaved runways.

1.8   Aerodrome reference point (ARP)
The aerodrome reference point is the designated geographical location of an
aerodrome. The point chosen is usually one situated near the geometric centre of the
aerodrome.
1.9   Aerodrome reference temperature (ART).
The aerodrome reference temperature is the monthly mean of the mean daily
temperature (24 hours) for the hottest month of the year (T1) (the hottest month being
that which has the highest mean daily tem perature) plus one-thir d of the difference
between the monthly mean of the maximum daily temperature for the same month (T2)
and the aforementioned monthly mean temperature (T1) i.e.Both T1, and T2 should
be averaged over a period of years.
1.10   Rescue and fire fighting facilities.
Adequate rescue and fire fighting vehicles, equipment and personnel have been
provided at most of the aerodromes available for use by international commercial air
transport.
The scale of protection has been determined in accordance with the guidance
given in Attachment C to Annex 14.
At the other major aerodromes the rescue and fire fighting equipment provided is
usually suitable to their operating requirements.
1.11   Visual ground signals:
a) Of the visual ground signals contained in Appendix A to Annex 2, none have
significance in the Republic of South Africa, with the exception of Para. 4.2.4
“Closed runways and taxiways”.
b) Closed manoeuvring areas, runways and taxiways.
1. Day markings.
Crosses of a single conspicuous colour, preferably white, displayed horizontally on
the manoeuvring area shall indicate the limit s of an area unfit for the movement of
aircraft. In the case of runways and taxiwa ys the crosses shall be displayed at each
end of the unserviceable part and over the ent ire length of the unserviceable part at
distances of not more  than 300 M if the unserviceable part exceeds a distance of
300 M.
2. Night markings.
On manoeuvring areas used at night, unserviceable areas shall be 
delineated by
fixed aviation red lights placed along the edge and at such corners of the area as may
be necessary clearly to indicate the extent of the area, except that, where aircraft
movements are limited to runways and taxiways, a runway or taxiway or portions
thereof may be closed for taxiing purposes by placing aviation red lights across the
entrance and exit of the section rendered unusable by reason of an unserviceable
area, and by 
extinguishing the runway or taxiway lights between the delimiting red
lights.

c) Traffic pattern indicator.
A traffic pattern indicator is used to indicate whether a right or left hand circuit
should be followed in respect of a specific runway direction.
The indicator comprises, depending on the number of runways, a series of L
markings around the wing cone circle.
The orientation of the markings coincide with that of the runways at the aerodrome
where the indicator is displayed.
The L-shaped markings indicate whether a left or right hand circuit is in force. Thus
when runway a or runway b is in use, a right hand circuit must be flown while, when
runways c or d are in use, a left hand circuit is applicable.
1.12   Stop bar Procedures
Signs markings and lighting act as safety nets to prevent drivers or pilots from
entering a runway incorrectly. Stop bars are provided at certain airports to assist
in protecting the runway against a Runway  Incursion. Airports using stop bars
today typically equip the CAT II/III holding point as a compliment to the pavement
marking and signage according to ICAO.
A stop bar consists of a row of unidirectional lights embedded in the pavement and
spaced equally across the taxiway at the associated holding point, normally at
right angles to the centerline. They show red towards an approaching aircraft
when lit. Stop bars are sometimes installed in association with green lead-on lights
which are a continuation of the taxiway centerline lighting beyond the stop bar.
The lead-on lights are interlinked with the stop bar so that when the stop bar is
red, the green centerline beyond the stop bar is unlit and vice versa.
Procedures for Stop bar Use
1) Pilots and Drivers shall never cross a red (lit) stop bar.
2) If instructed to cross a red stop bar pilots and drivers should challenge the ATC
to switch off the stop bar or provide alternative routing.
3) Pilots and Drivers may only cross a deselected stop bar/holding point when the
appropriate voice clearance has been issued by the ATC and read-back by the
pilot/driver. Pilots and Drivers should be careful not to assume clearance to
cross/enter a runway has been issued if the stop bar is not illuminated.
4) Should a stop bar fail ATC shall endeavour to provide an alternate clearance
that does not route via the failed stop bar.
5) Where a stop bar has failed and there is no alternative routing available or the
stop bar has failed at a runway entrance, a procedure shall be published either
via NOTAM or promulgated in the AIP describing under what conditions pilots
and drivers may be allowed to cross a lit stop bar. Should no such procedure

 AD 1.1-5
AIP South Africa
be published the pilots and drivers shall only cross the lit stop bar under the
direction of a Follow-Me vehicle when ATC has given an explicit clearance for
the Follow-Me vehicle to lead the aircraft onto/across the runway.
6) When a Follow-Me vehicle is used Pilots will be required to report the Follow-
Me vehicle in sight to the ATC. Thereafter all Radio Transmissions will be
directed to the Vehicle until the Driver of the Follow-Me vehicle reports
standing down.
7) When issuing a Conditional Clearance, ATC should only extinguish the stop
bar when the subject of the condition has passed and it is safe for the aircraft
or vehicle to enter the runway at that entry point at that time. 
8) Should a pilot or driver require clarific ation on a clearance issued they should stop
before the stop bar and request clarification from the ATC prior to crossing any
holding point. If in Doubt STOP and ask.

AD 2.9 SURFACE MOVEMENT GUIDANCE AND CONTROL SYSTEM AND MARKINGS
1 Use of aircraft stand ID signs, TWY guide lines and 
visual docking / parking guidance system of aircraft 
stands.
1) Allocation of parking
i) ACFT landing to CTC apron office on FREQ 122.65 
MHz prior to top of descent or when within VHF range 
for parking bay allocation. Parking bays to be 
confirmed upon landing. ACFT to give the following 
INFO, ACFT type, REG, ETA, POB and last AP of 
DEP
ii) Parking bay INFO and REG is to be transmitted to 
SMC on FREQ 121.9 MHz on vacating RWY for TAX 
instructions
iii) Before entering the apron ACFT are to contact 
ACSA Apron office on FREQ 122.65 MHz to verify if 
their gate is still available. Pilots are not to enter into 
discussion with SMC with reference to bay allocation 
as this is not their function.
iv) TWY G2 access into South African Police Service 
Airwing unavailable.
2) Operators of non-scheduled flights requiring use of 
the main apron must inform ACSA apron office on 
email address CIAApron@airports.co.za not later 
than 24 hours prior for parking bay allocation. The 
notification must contain the following information: 
date and time of arrival, date and time of departure, 
long term parking arrangements (i.e. main apron or 
general aviation area), Name of aircraft operator and 
contact details, Name of ground handler and contact 
details.
3) A docking system is installed on parking bays A3-
A17. The system works as FLW:
i. The system will display the ACFT type which 
means that is the type of ACFT that will park in that 
stand.
ii. The pilot must follow the arrows displayed by the 
azimuth for this will guide the ACFT on the centreline 
of the PRKG bay.
iii. The system will also display speed of ACFT. ACFT 
must approach at a speed of not more than 5.40 
knots.
iv. If it is too fast it will display slow down.
v. The system will also display distance from stopping 
position in meters and will count down in meters as it 
approaches.
vi. As the ACFT moves closer than 3M stopping 
position it will count down in 0.2 of a meter. 
vii. Should system be inoperative then marshalling 
will be as normal.
4) Pushback Procedures
i) Pilots leaving AD must advise the Airport Manager, 
via the Apron Office of destination and the number of 
PAX and crew on board. Apron Office FREQ 
122,65MHz, call sign “CAPE TOWN APRON”. 
Operators and companies may pass the above INFO 
by telephone to (021) 9371280 or by FAX *(021) 
9340932.

1 Use of aircraft stand ID signs, TWY guide lines and 
visual docking / parking guidance system of aircraft 
stands.
ii) Only the following information is to be passed to
Cape Town Ground Control FREQ 121.9MHz prior to
start up: Call-sign, Aircraft Registration, FL requested
and PRKG Bay. 
iii) ACFT are not to request pushback until the tug is
connected and ready to push. 
iv) An ACFT will commence pushback within 1 
minute of being given pushback.
v) The pilot is deemed responsible for the pushback 
and is to ensure that no incidents arise.
vi) Essential local traffic information will be passed by
air traffic control to the pilot in command for onward 
relay to the engineer. 
vii) All aircraft in addition will monitor frequency 
122.65 MHz whilst on the aprons.
5) Due to reduced wing-tip clearance distances all 
ACFT with a wing span of 52m or greater must use 
apron taxiways to only access the ACFT stands on 
the main aprons and not as a throughfare. ACFT 
using apron taxiways must reduce taxi speed to 10 
knots or below.
6) Due to the proximity of the service road to B10
ACFT parking bay, ACFT that power out of this bay 
must adhere to the taxi guide lines markings.
7) 4 power in power out parking bays (B19, B22, B25 
and B28) in use on B north apron. These parking 
bays can also be used to park aircraft nose in.
8) All pilots operating the Boeing 777X (777-900) 
shall not extend the wingtips when taxing on taxiways 
& taxilanes. The wingtips must then remain folded for 
taxing to and from the parking bay. Taxiways & 
taxilanes are not configured to accommodate taxing 
code F aircrafts. The wingtips must only be extended 
when the aircraft is lined up at departure threshold.
2 RWY and TWY markings and LGT RWY 01/19 marked and lighted,
RWY 16/34 marked and lighted except the centreline 
only marked.
All TWY centreline, holding positions and TWY/RWY 
intersections marked.
3 Stop bar All TWY intersections leading onto RWY 01/19, TWY
C and E have two stop bars each.
RWY 16/34 which is part of ACFT taxi circulation is 
not fitted with stop bars at the intersection onto RWY 
01/19.
RWY 01/19 guard LGT AVBL only on the western 
side, nil guard LGT on the eastern side.

6) Due to the PSN of the B APN, ACFT parked at
times reduce the ATC visibility of RWY 16/34 and 
TWY A2. OPR are to take note that although LDG 
and TKOF clearances are issued by ATC, these
clearances are based only on these portions that are 
visible to ATC at the time the clearance is issued as 
well as the known and reported situation on the RWY

General
1) The pilot in command wishing to cross or join controlled or advisory airspace shall: call the responsible ATC unit 
on the designated frequency 10 minutes before joining such airspace and maintain two way radio communication 
on the appropriate radio frequency. When RWY 06 is in use ACFT will not be permitted to depart from TWY H, and 
may not enter TWY H from TWY A for any reason.When RWY 24 is in use ACFT will not be permitted to depart 
from TWY G, and may not enter TWY G from TWY A for any reason. Intersection takeoffs will not be permitted 
between 2000 and 0400. The intersection around TWY N, G and A is a designated Hotspot and as such extra 
vigilance is required by pilots. No ACFT may pass each other on the taxiways at this intersection.
2) All ARR ACFT to EXP CLR for ILS Y unless otherwise directed by ATC.

AD 2.24 CHARTS RELATED TO AN AERODROME
Whenever IFR ARR and/or DEP occur at FAPP , the FAPI circuit will be required to be sterile. This will be
achieved by one of the following means as advised by ATC:
(1) FAPI circuit TFC will be required to leave the FAPP CTR by the shortest RTE.
(2) ALT FAPI circuit TFC can reposition and join the FAPP active circuit.
All circuits RWY 08/26 are to be flown remaining OHD or east of R37 national road.
Pilots unable to comply are to inform FAPP ATC.
The following procedures will apply for all arriving, departing and local flights:
1) Circuit procedures
(a) All circuits to be carried out at 5 100 FT ALT.
(b) RWY 26 in use - left hand circuits.
(c) RWY 08 in use - right hand circuits.
(2) RWY ELEV - THR 08 - 4228 FT, Mid RWY - 4284 FT, THR 26 - 4354 FT.
(3) ACFT must adhere to RWY’s and TWY’s and park in the parking area.
(4) All flights (IFR and VFR) departing FM FAPI are to establish 2-way communications with Polokwane
(FAPP) ATC on FREQ 119.75 MHz before departure. If no CTC is AVBL with FAPP ATC on FREQ 119.75
MHz, CTC FAPP on telephone number: +27 15 288 0343 before TKOF.
(5) All TFC operating at FAPI are to maintain 2-way communication with FAPP ATC at all times and adhere to
ATC instructions. This includes flights operating in the Pietersburg AD TFC circuit.
(6) Nil circuit training will be accommodated at Pietersburg airfield when Polokwane CTR is declared IMC, and
VFR flights may be accommodated by Polokwane ATC on SVFR clearances. Outside Polokwane ATC HR of
SER, TFC operating at Pietersburg airfield are to broadcast intentions on Polokwane FREQ 119.75 MHz

7R e m a r k s REQUIREMENTS
Helicopters are not permitted to:-
i) Hover training on or near the runway (including the grass area 
between the runway and taxiway and near the hangars or buildings) 
unless the ATC has given that specific helicopter permission to do so.
ii) Helicopters must fit in with the circuit traffic
iii) A helicopter stationary on the runway or flight strip or in the hover 
renders the runway unsafe.
iv) Hover training to be done at the designated helicopter pads or at 
the ATC discretion. 
v) Helicopters, once given take off clearance from the helicopter pad 
must proceed to the runway and take off as per ATC clearance.
vi) The compass swing bay is not to be utilized as a hovering area or 
helipad.
vii) Due to proximity of parked ACFT, the apron is not part of the 
manoeuvring area and does not fall under ATC jurisdiction, no 
permanent parking in front of the terminal building, only used as drop 
off and go for ACFT.
viii) Pilots to exercise caution when taxiing due to close proximity of 
parked ACFT.
HOLDING POINT
It was established that to ease congestion at the holding point 23, a 
second holding point be demarcated.
This in effect should leave a gap between the two points in which 
helicopters utilizing the Starlight helicopter pad can proceed without 
having to fly over aircraft holding at the holding point.
Holding point two (2) is the furtherest one from the runway and on 
busy days the ATC will hold all aircraft at this point and let one at a time 
through to the first holding point. Once cleared for take off the ATC, at 
their discretion will let another aircraft through to holding point one (1).
HELICOPTER OPERATIONS
Helicopter operational hours are from 0400 to 1700 Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday.
Helicopter training on Saturday is BTN 0400-1100, and on Tuesday 
and Thursday BTN 0400- 1800. No training permitted on Sundays and 
public holidays.
Departing helicopters are expected to gain enough height as possible, 
to be clear of the residential areas on both sides of the aerodrome.

Note: All IFR TFC DEP FAVG outside of HR of duty of ATC must CTC Durban APCH on FREQ 125.75 MHz prior 
to departure for clearance to enter controlled airspace. If no CTC can be established on FREQ 120.6 MHz, ACFT 
are to get airborne and remain clear of controlled airspace and obtain clearance on FREQ 125.75 MHz to enter 
controlled airspace.
All TFC DEP FM FAVG that enter the Durban TMA or fly to FALE are required to request startup prior to DEP.
(1) Use of AD by Tri-Axis Fixed Wing microlight ACFT permitted.
(2) Twin engined aircraft are to use ASPH TWY only at all times.
(3) The control tower penetrates the Transitional Surface.
(4) ACFT to park in designated areas only. 
For noise abatement procedure, helicopters are to approach at higher altitude over the residential area 
(flying a normal approach path) and to cross the aerodrome boundary fence at no less than 300FT whenever 
practical and safe to do so.

FAVG AD 2.22 FLIGHT PROCEDURES
FAVG AD 2.23 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
FAVG AD 2.24 CHARTS RELATED TO AN AERODROME
The following deemed separation between arriving and departing IFR flights at King Shaka International 
and Virginia airports is based upon a Safety Assessment conducted by ATNS and has been implemented to 
enhance efficiency as well as to ensure a safe, orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic within the FALE/FAVG 
area of responsibility.
FAVG geographical position is 3NM east of the approach/take-off path of runway 06/24 at FALE and as such 
restricts IFR traffic to and from both airports.
This procedure will require IFR traffic departing from or arriving at FAVG, on ATC clearances to remain seaward 
of the coastline on headings, and will be deemed to be separated from IFR departing and arriving traffic at King 
Shaka International Airport (FALE).
This deemed separation will only be applicable when Surveillance Radar is in operation
at FALE.
In the absence of an IAP for IFR ACFT into FAVG the following PROC will apply, when WX minima restricts VMC 
descents into FAVG: inbound IFR ACFT to FAVG shall be accommodated on the ILS or VOR IAP to FALE to a 
minimum of 1000FT ALT. Should the ACFT not become VMC by 1000FT ALT, pilot will be requested to land at 
FALE.
Circuit: All circuits to be flown at 800FT and must be conducted seawards. Downwind legs over land not 
permitted.
Pilots must exercise caution due to flocks of birds on AD.
